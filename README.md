## ü§î Problem Statement:

The core problem is the **unreliability of online food reviews**. Platforms like Google Maps are saturated with **fake, bot-written, and promotional feedback**, making it nearly impossible for consumers to distinguish genuine experiences from fabricated ones. This erosion of trust not only leads to **disappointing dining choices** but also unfairly penalizes honest restaurants.

## üí° Our Solution: 

We made an AI browser extension that brings transparency back to online reviews. It provides users with a list of fake reviews for any restaurant's reviews, powered by AWS-backed AI engine.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Real-Time Analysis:** Instantly analyzes reviews on any Google Maps restaurant page.
*   **Advanced AI Detection:** Leverages Amazon SageMaker Studio to detect fake reviews based on linguistic patterns and behavioral cues.
*   **Simple & Intuitive UI:** We don't just provide a score. We display a transparent list of suspicious reviews, each with a reasoning analysis generated by AWS Bedrock and a calculated probability score, capped with a clear overall "85% Trust Score" directly on the page.
*   **Scalable AWS Backend:** Built on a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and API Gateway for reliable and cost-effective performance.
*   **Data-Driven:** Trained on a custom-built dataset of real and AI-generated fake reviews for high accuracy.
