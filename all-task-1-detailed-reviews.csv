"Update-July 2025
I went to try the nasi khaumok after seeing the banner, hoping it's like what my Thai neighbour used to make. But the original restaurant is closed and moved to KGRP Cafe, so we walked along the pool to get there. The view's nice, you can see people golfing and the driving range.

We had to wait 25-35 minutes because they still cook at the old kitchen. It was calm at first, but once the golfers came in, it got loud like a mamak stall. Even the staff were shouting across the cafe. We just tried to enjoy and relax after a long day, but it didn't really work.

We also took away a Double Trouble burger, looked good, asked for no veggies. But when we opened it at home, it was just bun and meat. No sauce, no flavour, and the patty didn't taste like homemade as claimed. Honestly, a Ramly burger would've been better.

Not sure what happened to the KGRP I used to know. Service and quality have dropped. Hope things improve soon

July 2024 -A nice restaurant with air conditioning and a quiet atmosphere is something we all need after returning from work or taking a break. We also expect a warm welcome from the waitstaff upon entering. The slow and steady music creates a cozy ambiance, making it feel like home. Overall, the food is decent, and the prices are reasonable. The standout dish was the Asam Pedas, which I highly recommend.

CONS - The new method of ordering via QR scan is less than ideal. While it was acceptable during the pandemic, it's no longer necessary now. Similarly, using QR payment at the counter is more convenient. Most customers would prefer having waiters come to the table to take orders, ensuring that their preferences are met, rather than relying solely on a menu.",FALSE

Provides choice of beef patties, lamb patties, and grilled chicken. I appreciate how the burgers are not overflowing with sauces. The burger is very balanced, not overwhelming, and the toppings do not take away from the delicious grilled burger patty.

It's rather mid-tier in terms of price for a stall burger, but it's definitely worth it, since it's not a Ramly burger. It starts at RM6.50 for a basic burger, and can go up to RM18 for a triple.

Order nasi goreng ayam, nak ayam tight dan nasi nak merah. and dapat ayam peha + nasi berwarna putih. still ok dengan ayam but then rasa nasi, macam nasi putih. idk (?). tak rasa nasi goreng. ayam pon macam tak masak. tepung macam tak sebati.

penambahbaikan :
1. kalau rasa tak mampu untuk handle customer ramai, jangan terima order.

3. bagitahu pada kaunter, kaunter cakap ""raya tak layan"", tolong baiki attitude

"Keropok Lekor Yanadin is a popular snack originating from the east coast of Malaysia, particularly Terengganu. It's known for its distinct chewy texture and fishy flavor, which appeals to many snack lovers.

### Taste
The keropok lekor from Yanadin stands out with its unique blend of spices that elevate the natural taste of fish. The authenticity of the ingredients shines through, providing a nostalgic experience for those familiar with traditional Malay snacks. The balance between saltiness and spiciness is just right, making it enjoyable on its own or paired with a spicy dipping sauce.

### Texture
One of the defining characteristics of good keropok lekor is its texture, and Yanadin does not disappoint. The keropok has a delightful chewiness that's satisfying to bite into, complemented by a crisp exterior when fried to perfection. It manages to retain its firmness without being overly tough, making each piece enjoyable to eat.

### Preparation and Serving
Keropok lekor can be prepared in various ways--either boiled for a softer texture or deep-fried for a crunchy finish. Yanadin's preparation method leans towards frying, resulting in a crispy outer layer while keeping the inside soft and flavorful. It's typically served as a snack or appetizer, often enjoyed with a homemade chili sauce that enhances its flavors.

### Packaging and Presentation
The packaging is simple yet effective, ensuring the keropok stays fresh. The portion sizes are generous, making it suitable for sharing during social gatherings or simply indulging alone. The product also emphasizes its homemade quality, appealing to those who value authentic, artisan snacks.

### Overall Impression
Keropok Lekor Yanadin captures the essence of traditional Malaysian snacking. Its quality taste, chewy texture, and cultural significance make it a must-try for anyone looking to explore Malaysian cuisine. Whether you're a fan of snacks or new to keropok lekor, Yanadin offers an experience that's hard to resist.

"Honestly, I don't understand how the food here is considered good. The mushroom soup was overly creamy to the point of being overwhelming, and the garlic bread lacked flavor (we thought this would be the safest thing to order!). The chicken from the burger tasted like it had been frozen, with a pale, rough patty drowned in sauce. The ""Korean fried chicken"" in another burger was just regular fried chicken with an excessive amount of gochujang sauce--nothing special. Wedges were surprisingly soggy. Fries also didn't taste fresh.

When requesting additional cutlery, a waitress bluntly said, ""self-service, take it yourself"" without indicating where to find it. Only after approaching the barista did I manage to locate the cutlery station.

The payment process was also inconvenient where card payments were not accepted, and no clear guidance was provided on alternative payment methods. A more customer-friendly approach, such as politely explaining available options like e-wallets, would have improved the experience.

Given the above-average pricing for a cafe in Sibu, one would expect better customer service. Poor hospitality can easily overshadow an otherwise good dining atmosphere. With increasing competition from other cafes in the area, The Coffee Code could benefit from improvements in customer engagement, upselling skills, and a more welcoming attitude.

"Extremely Disappointed - First and Last Visit

This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had, and I will not be returning.

The staff were unprofessional, inattentive, and clearly lacked training. Despite a mandatory 10% service charge, they made no effort to engage with or care for the customers. I had to personally ask them to clear the table, refill water, provide cutlery, and even for basic items like serviettes. Meanwhile, the staffs just stood behind the counter, waiting to be called instead of proactively serving.

There was also no structure to the meal service--everything was brought out at once with no order or care. Main dishes lwere served before the starter, which completely ruined the dining flow.

We ordered a premium Wagyu beef set which came with three types of salt. When I asked the supervisor how to pair them, the response was simply, ""Just do whatever you like,""--no explanation, no recommendation, and no professionalism.

The 10% service charge is completely unjustified. The service provided didn't even meet the most basic expectations. Extremely disappointing and not worth a second visit.",FALSE

I haven't got the time to eat the whole day since I was so occupied but only to be received a food like that. You can't never mess with someone that's starving/thirsty. I sent the meal back. Again... waited for 15 minutes and received a bit small thigh chicken. But mind you, the chicken was overcooked on the outside but still a bit bleeding from the inside. Please. Don't mess with the food like that then bluntly served it to the customers. It seems like the chef cooked it with maximum level of fire cause they thinks it will cook on time. But, you're wrong. You can't never cook it on maximum level of fire. You have to set it in medium so that the meat on the inside is well-done. No matter how many customers orders during my time spend there, but cook it nicely. Don't rush it just because you needed to get it out from the kitchen and let the crew take it from the window. I won't go dine here again since last time, I was having lunch with my fellow friends and greeted by cockroach behind our seats. I have gave this specific branch so many chances but that night? Was my last straw to dine-in ever again. Sorry. But, good luck with the business.

My favourite pitstop for kampua babi or wantan if I stop by Sibu or stay there. This cafe is always packed with people so you need to be patient.

They serve other food too, such as laksa, nasi, mee goreng etc. But if you want to eat kampua, you should choose the front seat instead of the back one, so that it is easy for you to order and pick your own chopsticks and  soup at their self-service kampua counter.

Their beverages are one of the fastest I've encountered. You can now pay using QR code if you don't have any cash with you.

Ordered mee pok special and very disappointed on how it's taste. Very salty because of the fishcake. Why would you add fishcake walao. Special should be have internal organs of the pork. Doesn't worth the hype. Maybe kampua will taste better.,FALSE
"Their kampua is incredibly delicious and now I understand why they are so famous. Honestly, it is the best kampua I have ever had from all the places I have been to. The prices are very affordable too.

It was also my first time seeing such a big sized wantan. The wantan here is much bigger than anywhere else I have eaten in my life. However, I do wish the pork filling had more flavor because it was a bit bland. Also, the wantan was quite oily which made it feel a bit lejuk after a while.

Still, I would definitely come back here if I visit Sibu again. I will try the wantan again too and hopefully it tastes even better next time.",FALSE

The food overall the best. The only thing I find that needs to upgrade is the menu and the price.

This is my personal positive suggestion. I think it would be even nicer if the service crew could share a few more smiles to make customers feel warmly welcomed, or have small friendly chats. For example, a simple ""Excuse me, how's the food?"" would add a lovely personal touch. It would make the warm food come with equally warm service.

Service is tip top. About  10 minutes after my odering, my food already on the table. Keep up the good service. I also like their decoration.  Definitely gonna come again for the vibe and of course the food.

Edit: Nasi lemak has improved so much since my last visit. Now masa lalu has become my favorite place to eat Nasi Lemak. Service also tip top as always.

So, my suggestion please do a code system for booking customers so otr people won't just walk in and steal our seats, admitting our booking was theirs and you guys didnt check, and just give our book away.

2. **Fried Fuzhou 'Mun' (Braised Yellow Noodles)**: Springy noodles stir-fried with vegetables and a hint of nostalgia.

3. **Snow Veggies Salad**: A refreshing medley of crunchy greens, drizzled with sesame dressing.

4. **Thai-Style Midin Kerabu**: Wild fern shoots tossed in a zesty Thai dressing a burst of flavours.

5. **Steamed Freshwater Grouper**
The fish arrived, glistening, adorned with hot oil, shallots, and ginger. Each flake melted in our mouths.

"Sing Ming Kee Cafe has long held a presence in the local food scene, with a history of serving Kampua noodles for decades. My parents remain fond of the place, likely drawn by a sense of nostalgia and familiarity. However, the experience during my recent visit did not quite live up to expectations.

The ordering system is outdated and inefficient, with orders taken manually from table to table. Despite arriving and ordering earlier, our food was delayed, while other tables that came & ordered later than us were served first. When we raised this to the waitress, she insisted on prioritising the other tables because they ordered fewer items. This decision undermines the basic principle of first come, first served, and reflects a lack of fairness in service flow.

Furthermore, the noodles were not prepared according to our instructions. While the taste was average, it did not stand out, and the portion felt relatively small compared to the price point.

If not for my parents' preference, I would likely not make a point to return. There is still a loyal customer base, but service quality and overall experience need real improvements to appeal to a wider audience today.",FALSE

"This restaurant consistently serves some of the best sushi I've ever had. The sushi is always freshly prepared, flavorful, and of excellent quality -- each bite is a delight.

The environment is comfortable and generally pleasant, though I find the seating arrangement a bit cramped, as the tables are placed quite close to each other. A little more space between tables would enhance the dining experience.

Customer service here is exceptional. The waitstaff/waitress are extremely friendly, attentive, and welcoming. I would gladly give them 5 stars, or even more if possible. Their hospitality is one of the main reasons I continue to return and remain a loyal regular customer.

However, I have noticed some inconsistency in the kitchen's preparation time. While the sushi is worth the wait, the preparation can sometimes take 30 minutes to over an hour, which can be challenging during busy periods. I hope the kitchen team can improve efficiency, as faster service would make the experience even more outstanding.

Overall, this sushi restaurant offers excellent food, a comfortable (though slightly crowded) atmosphere, and top-tier customer service. With some improvement in kitchen speed, it would easily earn even higher praise.",FALSE

3 months ago the food was delicious. I remember their soup being quite amazing, and the grilled chicken as well. With that hope in mind my family visited the shop once more on to find that :
1. The chicken was undercooked.
2. The sauces were overloaded and did not go well together.
3. The drinks (which were the same) came in totally different cups.
4. The food my grandma ordered which was tomyam fried rice tasted like anything but tomyam.

The list could go on and on but I'll stop it here. In easy words : simply do not go to Southman unless you can turn back the clock to 3 months ago. Has management changed? Different chef? Please do tell because things are no longer the same.",FALSE

Worst experience I had visiting a restaurant. Yesterday I went with my family, we decided to have a breakfast before attending an event later on, as we initially decided not to went for the event with an empty stomach.

There was no one beside us that morning, (9.30am). After more than 30 minutes the food still didn't arrived.

The ceremony we intend to go to was starting. We decided to change it to an take away.

Workers were fooling around and no one was speeding things up for us... Very disappointing.

We complained about the time for them to prepare the food. The lady at the counter was extremely rude.

She reply : How many minutes?
We said : 30.

Dari pengamatan saya, kualiti makanan semakin kurang contohnya kari daging sekarang dah dipenuhi dengan lemak daging kandungan daging amatlah sedikit berbanding dengan lemak.  Boleh lihat lemak terapung apung diatas. Saya pernah ambil seekor sotong bila dijamah rasa masam tapi saya tetap bayar, tuan kedai sepatutnya rasa dulu sotong tersebut kalau betul janganlah diletakkan diparas lauk lagi.   Lauk lain pun hambar tidak seperti dulu.  Harga pun agak mahal berbanding dengan kedai lain.  Pemilik kedai juga hendaklah menjaga kebersihan persekitaran.

"AVOID THIS RESTAURANT AT ALL COST.
We are retirees ( 4 pax ) and travel extensively to enjoy food and places. And as regular customers, we are quite familiar with food prices vis a vis the restaurant types, the food types, the  services and environment.
We were virtually ripped off for the dish shown in the photo;  3 slices of sting ray steamed in salted vegetables which we ordered for a small portion.
This dish was charged at a staggering RM72. When we questioned the lady boss on the price, she said she wasn't aware of the price and directed us to ask the rude elderly lady waitress. We asked both how much the sting ray fish was priced at per kg basis.
They both tried to explain in uncertain terms and excuses as to seasonal price surge, different specie etc and finally told that the sting ray price was RM120 per kg. This exorbitant price was even more expensive than river fish such as Sultan fish ( Jelawat ), Tengalan fish and only just slightly cheaper than marble goby.
Service was pretty rude and the place was infested with houseflies as evident from the dead houseflies trapped on the flypaper/fly trap at the cash counter.

 Tip: Bring patience--food is worth the (brief) wait.

cuma kali ni order lain cket, chicken chop! ayam dia memang lembut, cuma yang menyedapkan chicken chop dia adalah dia punya sos shj. kalau sos dia habis rasa mcm mkn ayam salut tepung gandum means tak ada spice lah.

Air dia selalu saya order semua yang big cup punyer sbb nak shared je dgn suami. semua menu air big cup sedap2.

sate dia memang sedap tapi pelik sbb saya order 5 cucuk katanya dia caj 1.20 so that's means RM6 shj lah tapi dia caj kuah kacang termasuk sayur2 lah kot RM5 uhuhuhu hurm mcm pricey jew. entah lah saya pon tak tahu sbb husband mkn sate dkt tmpt lain hg sama 1.20 tapi dia tak caj kuah kacang. so itu lah dia sedap tapi for me agak pricey. hehe

sebelum ni mkn biasa habis dlm 70 or 80 something. tapi kali ni alhamdulillah dpt lah berjimat sikit RM40 ehek. boleh lah sbb nk mkn mknn sedap. sekali sekala boleh lah.

kering poket kalau hari2 mkn sedap mcm ni. uhuhu. apepon2 saya memang suka mknn dia. sedap!

"My daughter likes cheese buns from your bakery. I took two buns, but when I gave my debit card to make payment, your staff said minimum must be RM 50, if not must pay cash. I didnt have cash on me. So I had to leave the buns behind. In this day and age, most of us use our debit cards to pay for almost 90% of our purchase. If I go anywhere to make purchases for low amounts (below RM 10) they accept. But unfortunately your management is not flexible. Perhaps because its being run by old generation? Bcausr this policy reflects old brain. Ahbeng brains! Yours is the only place so far I have come across making such ancient request.

Update (4 months later in May 2022)

While waiting for my pizza order next door, I decide to go again to buy some buns for my kid. This time, I made sure I had cash on me. When I tries to pay, the didnt have change but this time said I could you my debit card...

So I upgrade from 1 star to 3 stars

So that's an improvement. Good!",FALSE

"Saya sangat berpuas hati dengan pengalaman makan di RUMAH PUTEH @ Nibong Tebal. Antara menu kegemaran saya ialah Masak Lemak Cili Padi Ikan Jenahak - kuahnya pekat, pedas secukup rasa dan diseimbangkan dengan manis lemak labu. Memang padu!

Selain itu, menu Ayam Gepuk Pak Din Kalut memang wajib cuba. Ayamnya sangat rangup di luar tetapi lembut dan juicy di dalam - kalah ayam KFC! Tak hairanlah bila makan memang boleh jadi ""kalut"" sebab terlalu sedap dan membuatkan orang tak boleh berhenti menikmatinya.

Bukan sahaja makanannya yang enak, suasana di kedai ini juga sangat selesa dan unik kerana berkonsepkan rumah kampung lama yang diubahsuai. Pada waktu malam, pencahayaan lampu hiasan menambahkan lagi suasana santai dan mesra untuk makan bersama keluarga ataupun rakan-rakan.

Pekerja di sini sangat ramah, layanan pun cepat dan mesra. Tambahan pula, pemilik kedai sangat baik hati sehingga memberi diskaun 5% sebagai tanda penghargaan untuk review pelanggan.

Secara keseluruhannya, RUMAH PUTEH @ Nibong Tebal adalah tempat makan yang wajib dicuba. Makanan sedap, suasana tenang, layanan mesra - semuanya cukup sempurna. Semoga kedai ini terus maju jaya dan mengekalkan kualiti yang hebat ini

I am truly satisfied with my dining experience at RUMAH PUTEH @ Nibong Tebal. One of my favorite dishes here is the Masak Lemak Cili Padi Ikan Jenahak - the gravy is thick, rich, and perfectly spicy, beautifully balanced with the sweetness of pumpkin. Absolutely delicious!

Another must-try is their signature Ayam Gepuk Pak Din Kalut. The chicken is incredibly crispy on the outside yet tender and juicy on the inside - honestly better than KFC! No wonder they call it ""Kalut"" - once you start eating, you just can't stop because it's that good.

Apart from the food, the ambiance is also wonderful. The restaurant is set in a traditional village-style house, creating a warm and cozy vibe. At night, the hanging lights add a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere, perfect for dining with family or friends.

The staff are very friendly and attentive, and service is fast. I also really appreciate the kind gesture from the owner, who even gave me a 5% discount as a token of appreciation for leaving a review.

Overall, RUMAH PUTEH @ Nibong Tebal is a gem that I highly recommend. Delicious food, cozy atmosphere, and excellent service - everything is just perfect. I hope this restaurant continues to grow and maintain its amazing quality

To be fair, the owner did compensate by treating me to beverages, which I appreciate. But overall, service issues like these waste customers' valuable time (I lost almost an hour today), and if no improvements are made, this place won't go far.

""Nanti kita hantar yang lain.""

Leh sekali yang sampai tu still telur sama jugak, ada kesan sambal lagi. Adoii.

Bab meja pun satu hal. Ada ja staff duduk-duduk, tapi kita pula kena pergi kaunter bagitau nak duduk & minta tolong lap meja. Pun adoii.

Lepas tu, staff yang sama lap meja & angkat pinggan cawan. Tengah angkat tu, air tertumpah kena seluar. Percik ja la. Sorry pun takdak. Adoii lagi dan lagi.

"We originally planned to queue for the popular porridge place nearby (shop owner said the wait was 2 hours) and we decided to try this restaurant instead.

I'm glad we did.
*	Fresh ingredients : The vegetables are home-grown and have great wok hei.
*	Soups & fish: The fish ball and bitter-gourd soup are flavourful. The fish itself is fresh and the broth has a light laksa-style taste.
*	Fried chicken: Crispy and above average only

Prices are reasonable, the restaurant area is clean and I peeped the kitchen is well-kept. Even my wife, mother in law , sister in law and children who are normally picky eaters, had no complaints. I am surprised.

It's less crowded than the porridge shop next door, but the food quality holds up.
Tip: the shop front sign is in Chinese (no English or Malay), so look for the one beside MR DIY.

A great find when you don't feel like waiting in line
Shop photo shown is i took from google.
Dishes photo is I took after eating halfway because i want to this shop a rating.  Initially i self thought the dishes will be bad because only me one table but i am totally wrong.

Aku beli keropok, beras, dan beberapa keperluan dapur lain seperti bawang, sayur, dan sedikit lauk basah. Pilihan barang memang banyak, dan kebanyakan peniaga kat situ ramah serta sedia bagi harga berpatutan.

Keropok yang aku beli rangup dan segar, ada yang jenis goreng dan juga yang mentah. Rasa dia memang asli, sesuai sangat kalau nak simpan buat kudapan kat rumah. Beras pula aku beli dari salah satu gerai tempatan - katanya dari kampung sekitar Kelantan, dan kualitinya memang nampak cantik. Harap-harap tanak eloklah nanti.

Sayur dan barang basah pun segar, ada banyak pilihan dari yang biasa sampai ke yang jarang jumpa. Suasana pasar agak sibuk tapi masih terkawal. Parking mungkin sedikit mencabar kalau datang lewat, jadi kalau nak datang, better datang awal pagi.

Secara keseluruhan, beli barang dapur kat Pasar Besar Tanah Merah memang puas hati. Barang segar, harga okay, dan banyak pilihan tempatan yang susah jumpa kat pasaraya biasa. Confirm aku akan repeat lagi nanti!",FALSE

Paling best, harga dia tak cekik darah. Untuk portion besar & rasa sedap macam ni, memang susah nak jumpa dengan harga berpatutan. Terima kasih owner bagi harga murah, boleh rasa banyak jenis..

Suspect that they have limited offerings which they limit to what they do best- we ordered the roast duck, sweet and sour pork ribs, midin and cangkuk manis. Roast duck skin was perfect. Pork ribs was tasty and the veg done right.

The sweet and sour pork ribs dish is amazing. Highly recommended alongside the duck!

Service is good and quick, no printed menu so you'll need to ask for the daily menu and prices.

"I gotta be honest, i am not really a fan of the ""viral! cheezy leleh!"" Boombastic marketing and manner of treating food that unfortunately most Malay food providers do. While i try my best to avoid these, due to a work trip and looking for halal place for my Muslim collegues we ended up here.

I am a big fan of burger. It is not hard to make me happy with burger. But sometimes too much is just too much. I ordered the teriyaki burger- everything is fine but there is just too much bonito flakes on it. Save it, stretch it a bit more, less is more, you dont have to put so much for ""meletup leleh viral!""

Colleagues order both the korean chicken and itaewon burger- both with red presumably gochujang sauce- which also unfortunately too spicy for the guys. I consider myself able to take some heat but that is a bit too spicy.

I guess it might be quite easy to be a popular place in Sri Aman, no offense, but I do hope this place improve. I'll surely visit again (business trip) and I want to have a better experience next time. Hope this place read the comments",FALSE

The food was mediocre- but guess it is ok for Sri Aman standard? The pasta was bland and dry. The butter chicken rice was too sweet. The fish and chips saves the day, it was acceptable despite being dory. The chips needs a bit more time in the fryer. The fried chicken is a bit under seasoned.

The drinks is also a mixed bag. The chocolate was ok but the matcha was too fragrant with unusual flowerly smell that unmatcha like.

"definitely the worst sugarbun outlet in sarawak. it was my first ever experience ordering fast food and waited for almost 1 hour for my food to be served. not even a drink served immediately, though i came in when there was not even a customer there. i visited at 1130 and no food were ready to be served, obviously cause they just started to fry the chicken after i ordered my meals 

not to mention the atmosphere, no complete food storage or display like any other franchises, advertisements poster they just tape it on the wall, ants found everywhere from the counter and the sink had no water + i cant found any toilets here too.

the taste of the food was different too, the savoury rice tastes just like plain rice. didnt know what happened in the kitchen and this franchise.

to manager or supervisor, please improve your service and outlet. send your staffs for training and upgrade the interior. i am sorry to say this but the vibes and atmosphere from this outlet seems the same as all the 88 / 95 / 99 cafes in sarawak, iykyk. i just felt uncomfortable while eating here. ;(((((",FALSE

Servis di sini memang pantas dan cekap walaupun pelanggan ramai. Rasa betul-betul '1 Malaysia' sebab masa makan boleh dengar pelbagai dialek -- ada dari Sarawak, Kedah dan lain-lain. Harga pula sangat berpatutan berbanding portion makanan.

Makanan memang sedap, terutamanya ikan bekok dan ulam-ulaman. Dah lama tak makan ulam jantung, rasa puas hati bila dapat di sini. Secara keseluruhannya memang terbaik! Tahniah pada Nasi Ulam Cikgu kerana berjaya kekalkan kualiti dan suasana.

"Kelantan Trip Day 1 Part 4

Note: The best Teo Chew restaurant in town, better than most restaurants in Klang Valley. Please do not attempt walk-in on weekends. Reservation is a must!

Who would knew that such impromptu decision would turn out to be the best dinner in KB? Since the restaurant was closed on Wednesday, I had to make last minute attempt to walk-in on Tuesday evening.

The restaurant was literally packed but luckily one table was about to leave. Looking at the lady owner with Bambi eyes, I asked if there was any table without reservation and she said yes!

Oyster Omelette - definitely not stingy on the delectable oysters, as witnessed by the sheer number of the marine bivalve mollusc spread on top of the omelette.
Eight Treasure Chicken - filled with stuffing and we tore all the meats off the bone effortlessly. Flavourful gravy which I mixed with the rice before wiping them off.
Niu Tou Mian or Gu Tau Mee - despite the name, it contained no beef but seafood. My first time eating Teo chew style braised noodle that had minimal alkaline taste and I had to give thumb up to them. Delicious!
Teo Chew steamed siakap had a light taste  yet flavourful, salty yet just at a right degree.. plus that fresh barramundi was very appetizing.
Braised Chinese Cabbage with dried scallop - never thought that I'd say but this was actually my dish of the night. For a meat lover like me, I couldn't resist but to heap praise for this bland-looking yet luscious dish topped generously with dried scallops. My dish of the evening!
Orh Nee - Yam paste with ginkgo might be the best that I've ever tasted after so long since the last time I had one in the now-defunct Formosa SS2. This dish was so popular that it actually had to pre-book but I told the boss that we loved Orh nee so much that she somehow miraculously brought out a small plate for us. Very profound yam taste yet not too sweet.

I simply love almost everything on the table that evening. Didn't expect to find the best Teo Chew food in Pantai Timur.

An old school Teo Chew restaurant that might not have been refurbished nor renovated from day one, it is located along the day to the famous Dataran Cheng Ho (dubbed Chinatown of KB) where parking can get tricky but worth the effort!",FALSE

"Hidden Gem with Incredible Food and Warm Hospitality-

I'm not usually one to write reviews, but after tonight's dinner at Hiang Lang, Kelantan I felt compelled to do something different--I personally went to congratulate the chef, who also happens to be the owner.

This restaurant has been around for 60 years and is run by a dedicated family of four. The father and son work their magic in the kitchen, while the daughter and another son ensure everything runs smoothly at the front.

Now, let's talk about the food--simply outstanding.
*	The oyster omelet was mouthwatering.
*	The fish and noodles were so clear and fresh, full of delicate flavors.
*	The soup? Wow. Just wow.
*	The kai lan had that perfect wok hei (wok-fired taste).
*	And the duck--absolutely incredible.

To top it all off, after I paid, they still brought out a platter of crackers and fresh fruit, a gesture that truly reflects their warmth and generosity.

Amazing food, genuine hospitality, and a family that takes pride in their craft--Hiang Lang is a must-visit! Your fans from Singapore ",FALSE

Penangan Racun Khairul Aming - Perut Kenyang, Hati Gembira, Kaki Lenguh!

Gara-gara terpengaruh dengan Khairul Aming la ni, kami pun terjebak. Dan ya ampun, racun dia memang menjadi! Tiap kali balik KB, kedai ni auto jadi checkpoint pertama. Lupakan diet anda buat sementara waktu, di sini dosa terindah.

Nasi Kerabu Tumis dia yang ada ayam + daging tu... perghhh, rasa dia tak boleh bawak bawak bincang! Padu beb! Harga pulak tahap ""eh biar betul?"", mesra poket sampai rasa nak peluk tokey kedai. Bayar bawah RM 11 untuk hidangan kayangan macam ni memang satu kemenangan.
OK, sebelum korang datang menyerbu, baca dulu Manual Kelangsungan Hidup di Sini:

* Misi Beratur: Korang akan nampak 2 lane. Lane KIRI untuk geng dine-in (yang nak makan sambil feeling-feeling). Lane KANAN untuk geng tapau (yang nak makan kat rumah sambil layan Netflix). Jangan salah lane pulak, nanti kena lambat. Kalau tersalah line pun, adik tu akan transfer order awak ke line sebelah. Xyah la beratur dari belakang.

* PANTANG LARANG PALING BESAR: JANGAN SEKALI-KALI COP MEJA!* Ini pesanan khidmat masyarakat ikhlas dari saya. Tolonglah, jangan letak beg, botol air, apatah lagi ahli keluarga yang tak bersalah kat meja, lepas tu korang pergi beratur sejam. Kesian kat orang lain yang dah pegang nasi, pusing-pusing cari meja macam cari jodoh tak jumpa. Dah nak dapat makanan, baru hantar ""unit peninjau"" pergi cari port. Kita kena la bertimbang rasa.
* Taktik Tambahan:
* Solo/Duo Rider: Kalau datang sorang atau berdua, jangan malu buat muka paling comel & tanya nak tumpang meja. Orang Kelantan sporting, silap-silap dapat kawan baru.
* Satu Batalion: Kalau datang satu kampung (10+ orang), hantar seorang ""komando"" sejam awal untuk risik dan tempah meja.
* Cara Bayar Futuristik: Sebelum ngap, jangan lupa jadi food photographer sekejap. Ambil gambar makanan korang. Nanti nak bayar, tunjuk je gambar tu. Senang, kan?
* Kuasa Duit Kertas: Walaupun kita dah di zaman moden, kat sini kuasa duit kertas masih unggul. Sediakan CASH secukupnya! Bayar pakai cash laju macam F1, tak payah tunggu bank loading macam internet zaman dial-up dulu. Cash is King, katanya.

Kesimpulan: Makanan 10/10. Pengalaman macam masuk Amazing Race sikit la. Tapi serius, sangat-sangat berbaloi. Pergi jangan tak pergi! Kalau tak sedap, tuntut kat Khairul Aming, jangan cari saya. Haha!

"SECOND REVIEW - 

We returned to Me'nate because we craved the Beef Ribs and wanted to try other dishes. This time, we ordered Mamamia Beef Carbonara, Beef Ribs, and redeemed an Angus Burger (750 points). Every dish was absolutely divine!

The Mamamia Beef Carbonara was one of the best pastas we've ever had in Kota Bharu. Rich, creamy, with just the right amount of beef strips and garnish.

The Angus Burger was also delicious, featuring a thick, juicy patty and flavorful caramelized onions.

And, of course, the Beef Ribs remain our all-time favorite dish: a must-try for anyone dining here.

A special mention goes to one of the staff, a lady in a blue shirt (we assume she's the manager). She explained the menu very well and gave excellent customer service. Kudos to her! We didn't get her name, but our receipt listed ""Aisyah.""

We also found out that the free drinks come with every steak order, which explains what we received during our first visit.

Overall: This visit was an amazing experience. A big thumbs up to Me'nate Kota Bharu for stepping up their food and service quality.

FIRST REVIEW - 

We went for a late lunch around 3 pm and sat at the ground-floor dining area since the upper floor was still closed. Our order was Beef Ribs and a Trio Cheese Pizza.

What we liked:

1. The menu offers a wide selection of meats and is simple to understand.

2. The Beef Ribs were excellent: falling off the bone with a well-seasoned marinade. Definitely a dish we would order again.

3. We enjoyed bottomless drinks (honeydew and grape). They weren't reflected in the bill, so we assume they were free.

4. The restaurant has a loyalty points system that allows you to redeem rewards on your next visit.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. The Trio Cheese Pizza was just average. While the toppings were generous, the base felt more like bread than pizza dough. It needs improvement.

2. The ground-floor dining area is poorly lit, especially near the kitchen. The toilet is also placed in full view, which is not ideal for layout or ambiance.

3. Customer service was disappointing. For such a well-known restaurant, we expected above-average service.

Overall: An above-average experience, so we rated it 4 out of 5 stars.",FALSE

The people were friendly and spoke English well enough for us to order. They also helped us with ordering for spice levels. The restaurant needs a bit of a facelift with one wall paneled in particle board(!). But this is a minor issue and the food is what you are going for.",FALSE

The famous Roti Kaya? Please. Dry, boring, and nothing special. The drinks? Super ordinary! I've had better from a random stall. Honestly, this whole place is built on nostalgia hype, but the reality is just bad vibes and worse service.

"Visited White House Kopitiam expecting a classic kopitiam experience, but unfortunately, it was a big letdown. The service was extremely slow -- we had to keep waving for attention, and even then, the staff didn't notice us for quite some time. It felt like we were invisible. No one came to take our drink orders until much later, and by then, the experience had already soured

When the drinks finally arrived, the Milo was particularly disappointing. It tasted nothing like real Milo -- more like flavored water than the rich, chocolatey drink you'd expect. The toast was average at best, definitely not something worth coming back for

Overall, the food was just okay, but the poor service ruined the visit. Sadly, this will be our first and last time here. With so many other good kopitiams around, this one is not worth the wait or the frustration

Tu yg mcm nk halau customer je.

And is it HALAL certified? Please check before coming.

Patutlah tak ramai org lokal recommend tmpt makan ni, rupa2nya perangai buruk mcm ni. Ini kali pertama dan terakhir dtg sini. Harapnya customer yg ada niat nk dtg pun fikirlah betul2 sebelum dtg sini. Baca lah jugak review yg 1 star yg lain.",FALSE

HOWEVER, I have a few issues with the staff there. When I first arrived there, I don't know whether we have to wait to be seated or not. There were a few staffs at the counter. Not only that they did not attend us properly as they KEPT CHIT CHATTING, but they also IGNORED us when we asked questions.

Next, our DRINKS TOOK TOO LONG TO BE SERVED. IT'S ONLY COKE??? What took so long? When we tried to reach the staff to ask about our drinks, they were so busy chit chatting and were not aware with their surroundings and customers. You talk so much as if your work is done? Your only job was to serve our COKE. That's it.

Third, the CLEANLINESS. Why is the decorations on the divider between tables were so RUSTY and COVERED IN DUST AND SPIDER WEBS??? So many staff yet none clean the decorations?

Yet, I have to compliment one staff (a chinese looking male staff) as he is the only one that I saw doing his job right. He cleans table, attend customers, taking orders, etc. You guys better promote him to a higher position.

Other staffs? What are they even doing? Makan gaji buta is it? Chit chatting all the time.

We arrived at the restaurant around 9 PM, and thankfully, they were open until 11 PM, so we were still able to enjoy dinner. Unfortunately, there were no drumsticks available by the time we arrived, which was a bit disappointing since chicken is usually the highlight in Korean cuisine. However, we decided to go for the garlic soy sauce drumettes and wingettes instead. The portion was decent, and the chicken was very crispy, but I felt that it wasn't marinated thoroughly--the flavor didn't fully soak into the meat.

We also ordered the spicy japchae, and wow--it was seriously spicy! They definitely used Kelantan chili padi, and it packed a real punch. It's not for the faint-hearted, but if you love spicy food, you'll enjoy it.

Despite the minor letdown with the chicken flavor, the overall experience was still satisfying. The place had a cozy vibe, and the staff were friendly and attentive. One lovely surprise was receiving a Byeon Woo Seok keychain when we settled the bill--a sweet gift that made my night, especially as a fan!

Overall, it's a nice place to dine, and I'll definitely come again to try more from the menu (hopefully with drumsticks next time!).",FALSE

Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. We ordered a hot dish (mee goreng), and it never arrived even after waiting for over an hour. Honestly, who takes an hour to cook mee goreng?

We followed up twice at the counter, and in the end, they refunded us. It's not about the money--it's about the time wasted and the mood it spoiled, especially when you're just trying to enjoy a short vacation.

" Worth the Trip - But Some Improvements Needed

We drove nearly 2 hours just to try out Hamara Dining, and overall, it was a pleasant experience. The food was generally very good, especially the Nasi Arab - flavorful and well-prepared.

However, the meatballs were a letdown. They were hard and tasted like they had been reused, possibly from the previous days. It really didn't match the quality of the other dishes.

We chose to sit outside, which was a bit hot, and we had to request for more ice several times. While the staff were very patient and polite, we felt that they were often not around when needed. We had to walk to them or call out just to ask for something simple like ice.

 Overall, we'd still rate it a 4-star experience. The food was mostly great, and the staff were kind. But to reach 5 stars, the team should focus on:
*	Ensuring food freshness (especially items like meatballs)
*	Being more attentive and present near the guests, especially for those dining outside

"After multiple visits, it's by far my favorite place to get comfort food! The dumpling soup is divine, with the broth being absolutely perfect. The fried yong tau fu pairs wonderfully with the dumpling soup.

We also usually get a plate of fried rice or fried kuetiau to share.

Don't forget to have canned herbal tea if you plan on having a cold beverage. It's absolutely delicious!

We're big fans of Chef Pong Dumpling!



First Visit

We went for dinner. The restaurant wasn't crowded and had plenty of seating. We ordered fried yong tau fu, dumpling soup, chee cheong fun, fried noodles, and fried kuetiau.

Here's what we loved about this eatery:
1.	The fried yong tau fu is great! It's fried to perfection--crunchy and flavorful.
2.	We really like the dumpling soup. The wrapper-to-meat ratio is spot on, and the broth is light and clean.
3.	The service is fast. It took less than 10 minutes to get all of our orders.

However, we have a few suggestions for Chef Pong:
1.	The fried noodles (mi goreng) are too dry and starchy. The noodles should be cooked longer or rinsed in hot water before frying. All the good flavors went into the eggs and tofu instead of the noodles.
2.	We would love it if Chef Pong could serve authentic chee cheong fun. Right now, it's just a thick rice noodle roll with yong tau fu sauce.

Overall, it's the perfect comfort food for us. We would come back because this is one of the few places that serves halal Chinese dishes",FALSE

I don't know what the strong reason for that OVER PRICE besides not printed receipt but luckily this shop have QR payment for solid evidence to me which proven that OVER PRICE.

 Roti sangkaya - manis sederhana, sesuai sangat jadi pencuci mulut.

"very happy and satisfied with my visit. cafe lives up to its name -- very cosy, clean and cool. staffs were also friendly and very accommodating.

i ordered:
-pho ga (chicken noodle soup) very refreshing.
-grilled chicken rice. it's nice.
-banh butter + kaya. i've always loved the texture of banh, it's slighty chewy and crispy too.
-iced matcha latte. not sweet and matcha tasted good. i believe they used high grade matcha powder, not the cheap ones.
-vietnam coffee jelly. basically vietnamese coffee with cincau. it's good too.

the portion of each meal is just nice for a small-moderate eater like me. you might have to order extra if you savor huge portion.

i hope people dont expect the food to be bursting with flavors like our local delicacies, bcs vietnamese food tend to be subtler in flavor yet they're still good and up to my liking. they're unique and yummy like that.

" A Weekend to Remember at Perdana Hotel Kota Bharu 

As a first-time visitor to Kota Bharu for the KBHM weekend, I wasn't sure what to expect--but Perdana Hotel turned my stay into a five-star experience from start to finish.
From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I was greeted with warm smiles and genuine hospitality that never wavered throughout my two-night stay. The staff here don't just do their jobs--they elevate the entire experience with their friendliness and attention to detail.

 24-Hour Gym Access: For someone prepping for a half marathon, having round-the-clock access to a well-equipped gym was a game-changer. No excuses, just results.
 Breakfast Bliss: The complimentary breakfast spread was nothing short of impressive--local delights, continental classics, and enough variety to fuel any kind of day, whether you're racing or relaxing.

 Comfort Meets Class: The room was spacious, spotless, and thoughtfully designed. After a long day, sinking into the plush bed felt like crossing the finish line in comfort.
Whether you're here for an event, a holiday, or just passing through, Perdana Hotel is the kind of place that makes you feel like you've arrived. I'll definitely be back--and I'll be recommending it to anyone looking for the best accommodation in Kota Bharu.

 Verdict: 10/10 stay. Perdana Hotel isn't just a place to sleep--it's part of the Kota Bharu experience.",FALSE

I recently dined at your restaurant and I wanted to share my honest feedback. While I've always enjoyed the food and service at your other branches, I was quite disappointed this time.

The portion size at this branch was noticeably smaller compared to what I usually receive at your other outlets, yet the price remains the same . It felt unfair and left me feeling unsatisfied with the value for money.

I hope this feedback can be taken into consideration, as consistency is key to maintaining customer trust and satisfaction. I truly enjoy your food and hope to continue supporting your brand.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Tried the laksa sarawak. Not bad. The broth is thick and creamy. I think the cook added a hint of curry inside but not overpowering the taste of the laksa.

"Bukan first time saya makan di restoran Anisa, tapi selalunya memang order roti canai saja. First time pula kali ni try order bakso. Tapi serius, kualiti makanan dia memang mengecewakan.

Mula-mula, bila makanan sampai, saya perasan portion dia sikit betul. Tapi saya fikir, ""Ah, mungkin memang standard restoran ni."" Jadi saya pun malas mahu bising.

Tapi yang paling bikin kecewa tu, saya order bakso, tapi yang dihidang tu bukan bakso pun, cuma fishball ganti daging bakso. Eh, ini sudah bukan bakso, ini macam soto sudah. Saya terfikir, tukang masak dia ni tidak peka ka dengan apa yang pelanggan order?

Lepas tu saya bilang pelayan, kami tidak perlu air minum banyak, cukup 1 saja. Tapi tiba-tiba dia hantar sampai 4. Hal kecil saja, jadi saya tidak mahu panjangkan. Tapi bakso dia masin betul, sampai tidak boleh tahan. Saya rasa tukang masak dia tidak perasan ka betapa masinnya sup dia. Saya sudah tambah lada banyak kali pun, tetap masin juga.

Saya kecewa sebab kualiti makanan dia memang jauh dari apa yang saya expect. Kalau betul tiada daging bakso, baik bagitau awal-awal, bukan main serve fishball saja lepas itu cakap itu bakso. Yang buat tambah kecewa lagi, harga dalam menu tulis RM6.00, tapi bila bayar, kena RM8.00.

Sejujurnya, dengan harga RM8.00, saya boleh dapat bakso yang jauh lebih sedap di tempat lain. Harap pihak restoran ambil perhatian dan tingkatkan kualiti makanan serta layanan kamu. Komen ini bukan mahu jatuhkan, tapi untuk kebaikan juga. Sekian.",FALSE

"I tried their Asam Pedas, and my first impression of the soup was that it tasted light. Despite being filled with spice flakes, it lacked depth in flavor and felt overly oily.

They added a lot of coriander, which I personally liked--it complements dishes like Laksa, Asam Pedas, and Tomyam well. At RM13.50 for this bowl, the pricing is reasonable. Overall, while the quantity and freshness are commendable, I wish the soup had a richer, more balanced flavor.",FALSE

Another must-try is their ayam masak merah. The chicken is tender, and the sauce is thick, slightly spicy, and sweet in just the right way -- a real comfort dish that pairs perfectly with rice.

There wasn't many people eating there (it was already around 3pm then) and the absence of a signboard with the kedai's name did not help.  We had to go around and then verify the view of the kedai with the photos in Google review to make sure.  I'd suggest the proprietor to put up a big clear kedai's name upfront quickly :-).

"I recently visited Restoran Sambal Cili Hijau in Bidor with my family for a satisfying lunch. Here's a rundown of our experience:

What We Ordered:

Ayam Penyet
Daging Gulai Cili Api
Extra tempe and tauhu goreng
Telur dadar
Various drinks

Experience:
The Ayam Penyet was a bit small compared to other places, like the one in the basement of Yik Fong Mall in Ipoh, which offers a larger portion for the same price. Here, it felt a bit pricey for the portion size. However, the sambal was incredibly spicy--even I found it challenging!

The Daging Gulai Cili Api was a standout. The meat was tender and easy to chew, with a pleasant turmeric flavor and just the right amount of salt. It was the best I've had in a long time.

Both the tempe and tauhu goreng were excellent, with the tauhu goreng being especially noteworthy and definitely worth trying.

For drinks, everything was good except the iced corn beverage, which lacked sweetness and wasn't enjoyable.

Ambiance:
The environment was cool and comfortable, making for a pleasant dining experience.

Recommendation:
Overall, I'd rate Restoran Sambal Cili Hijau 3 out of 5 stars. The food has its highlights, but there's room for improvement, especially with portion sizes and drink quality. It's worth a visit for the Daging Gulai Cili Api and the tempe and tauhu goreng.",FALSE

1. Menu shows there is small pot. The old uncle told me that small pot was finished (at 7.30pm? Seriously?) . I had to order big pot and it ended up we couldnt finish the food.

2. I ordered 2 normal claypot chicken rice (RM24 each) , they gave me the one with salted fish and chinese sausage (Rm31). I clearly stated i only wanted normal claypot when i placed order with the old uncle. I suspected that's their way of making extra profit.

3. Normal chinese herbal tea and barley drink costs RM4 per glass. I was shocked at this price as even PJ restaurant also never sell at this price.

4. Chicken rice tasted just normal. Nothing that 'wow' me but selling at the price tag of big city (RM31 big pot). Hmm.. Maybe targetting some naive tourists like me.

5. They gave me the price of normal pot only after i argued with them. It really spoilt the impression of bidor town to me when i felt conned by this restaurant.

Bila dah sampai di Meja, dan anak nak menjamu makanan Lauk Ayam tak ada.

Memang saya tak perasan ayam takda dalam pinggan masa bawa dulang ke meja, saya pergi ke kaunter nasi kenapa takda lauk ayam barulah dimaklumkan kena ambil lauk ayam di kaunter ayam, bila nak ambil ayam dan tunjuk resit dan maklumkan 3 pinggan nasi anak saya takda ayam , dia kata Abang nak ambil dua kali ni, TERUS AKU JERIT 'KAU INGAT AKU NAK BAGI KELUARGA AKU MAKANAN HARAM DENGAN MENIPU KE!

4. Ditulis dalam cartakan arahan, mengatakan acar sayur tu PERCUMA tak dimasukkan di dalam harga nasi tapi Acar tu hanya sekadar beri 3 hingga 5 hirisan aje. Bila saya minta lebih diberinya acar dalam mangkuk(utk 5 orang) tapi dengan riak muka tak puas hati(reaksi bahasa tubuh boleh dilihat jelas).

KECEWA SANGAT
1. Rasa bagi aku tak sedap berbanding nasi dagang orang terengganu yg pernah aku makan di kawasan  taman perumahan aku dan di beberapa kawasan di Terengganu. NASI DAGANG ATAS TOL Terasa seperti makan nasi kandar/Nasi Lemak Basmathi aje.

2. Sistem yg jelas menyusahkan Pelanggan dan tak membantu pelanggan.

3. Respon pekerja ramai yg sombong ketika menjawab pertanyaan jelas , ia bukan sikap rakyat terengganu sebenar(termasuk peniaga lain)...tapi di sini ia memburukan imej rakyat terengganu yang baik.

NASI DAGANG ATAS TOL ADALAH JENAMA PERNIAGAAN BUKAN PRODUK SEBENAR NASI DAGANG TERRNGGANU YG TERKENAL DENGAN KESEDAPANNYA - TAK SEDAP ADALAH JAWAPANNYA....

Kalau korang nak rasa yg lebih sedap boleh cuba NASI DAGANG KAK SU di Batu Buruk(Waze atau Google RAMLY  MART) lokasi kedai dia sebelah/sebaris.

Walau bukan rasa nasi dagang yang sebenar sebab aku pernah makan yang lagi sedap (sebab nak sesuaikan dengan selera prlancong dan beberapa penduduk setempat)tapi masih sedap(Rempah kuah nasi dagang dibuat sendiri).

1. Pelbagai pilihan makanan- dari lauk pauk spt ikan bakar, ayam percik,,ikan singgang dsb. Memang rambang mata.  Saya pilih ayam percik, sambal udang, kerabu taugeh & ulam-ulaman.

2. Tempat makan yang luas, ada banyak kipas angin. Tiada pendingin hawa tetapi suasana tidak begitu panas walaupun cuaca terik di luar. Pelanggan memang sangat ramai waktu tengahari

Cons
1. Kebersihan boleh diperbaiki dengan SOP pembersihan yang lebih baik. Saya lihat staf bersihkan meja tanpa gunakan penadah sampah, hanya ditadah dlm cawan plastik yang dikutip jadi banyak sisa makanan terjatuh atas lantai

2. Tray sangat sedikit jadi agak sukar untuk meletakkan pinggan lauk pauk jika datang bersama keluarga

You need to be quick and get your table. While your partner queing up to enter the restaurant, the other person need to hunt for the table. Once you secured your table, you need to clean up the previous person's plates & cup & wipe your own table. No staff will do it for you.
No water at most of the sink and the only sinks that has water only giving small water flow.
In terms of food, its nothing to shout about. Some of the dishes were tasteless and some were ok.
The owner should plan it better in terms of services and facilities since it is a school boliday and it has been operated for quite some time.

"Lauk banyak, rasa okay sedap biasa, tapi low stars utk overall experience. Sangat perlu improve keseluruhan utk memudahkan aliran trafik customer. Org mungking ramai sebab tgk banyak lauk dan famous, tapi nak repeat or recommend mungkin tak kalau tak improve system. Nak dapat makan tu banyak steps sgt nak figure out, trafik zig zag banyak berlanggar dengan org.
1. Nak ambil nasi beratur kat tengah.
2. Dah ambil nasi sendiri, beratur pula ikut line2 lain utk lauk2. Lauk banyak kiri kanan panjang berlanggar2 org.
3. Lepas siap ambil nasi dan lauk, beratur pula kena kira ambil bil dulu. Bukan bayar ye. Tak faham kenapa tak boleh nak mudahkan bayar je sekali.
4. 1 kerja lagi kena beratur nak bayar dekat cashier pulak, order air situ.
5. Lepas tu, tunggu pulak line sebelah cashier nak ambil air.
6. Tu belum kira nak cari meja nak makan. Susunan meja panjang2 kena share2 campur, tapi jadi sempit sgt laluan kerusi, tak boleh nak lalu org dah kalau dua2 side meja ada org duduk.
Kalau nak suruh datang ramai2 berpecah seorang cop meja, seorang cop line beratur pun tak settle masalah, org dtg nak makan pilih citarasa sendiri. Beratur dulu pun x settle kerja sebab makanan tak siap ambil dan kira dulu sebelum boleh line bayar. Nak tulis review ni pun pening sebab complicated cara dia. Maximum 2-3 steps cukup utk customer. Sayang kalau lauk banyak dan sedap pun tapi jadi rumit. Harap dapat improve betul2 layout dan system tu utk masa depan baru rasa nak repeat.
Btw, parking bagi saya agak sukar dan limited.",FALSE

The chicken chop was average, decent but nothing outstanding.
The real highlight was the Nasi Goreng Kambing Special - although meant for 2 pax, it can easily feed 3 (you may ask for packaging container to tapao the unfinished portion in case you fail the challenge). The lamb was meaty with a slightly chewy bite, carrying a sweet undertone. The rice itself was nicely balanced, not overseasoned and not too dry. Be warned - it's so satisfying you might overeat even when you're full!

The kuey teow goreng was alright, again served in a very big portion. Do ask to omit the chili if you prefer it less spicy.

Overall, hearty food with generous servings that make it worth a try.

"I had a very disappointing experience at this restaurant. While the place looks spacious and well-ventilated, there are some serious hygiene issues that need immediate attention.

First and foremost, I found a strand of hair in my mashed potatoes, which is completely unacceptable. It clearly indicates poor food handling practices and a lack of cleanliness in the kitchen. This ruined the entire meal for me.

Additionally, the trash bin located near the seating area was overflowing and emitting a very unpleasant smell. Sitting close to it was extremely uncomfortable, and it's shocking that it wasn't cleaned or managed regularly. No one wants to enjoy their meal next to the smell of garbage.

The food itself was average -- the burger and fried chicken were okay, but nothing special. However, even a decent meal can't make up for such poor hygiene standards.

I sincerely hope the management takes these issues seriously and improves both kitchen cleanliness and overall sanitation.",FALSE

This contradicted some comments where the queue was longer for takeaways. Although the wait was a bit more significant that we anticipated, it was definitely worth it. Being brought up with homemade Nasi Dagang from Kelantan, this is on par to a homecook meal. The Nasi Dagang felt ""clean"" and delicately balanced with freshness of the ""tongkol"" fish the highlight and just the right portion. Service was warm and I can understand the long wait as the staff takes great care in preparing the takeout with a clean kitchen counter despite the overwhelming people ordering.

"Sincere feedback from me as a chef--your tom yum tastes bitter and lacks depth. Let me share a few tips.

The issue likely comes from how you treat the tom yum paste. It's already been sauteed during production, so boiling it for too long will make it bitter.

Here's what you can do:

* Use a direct cooking method.
* Don't mix the paste into your clear fish stock from the start.
* Instead, bring your stock to a boil first, then add the paste and simmer briefly.

This way, your tom yum will taste fresher and more balanced.",FALSE

"went for breakfast at a spot with ample parking and a riverside view. I ordered the honey pancake and nasi lemak ayam.

The prices were slightly on the higher side considering the portion sizes--RM12 for the pancake and RM10 for the nasi lemak ayam.

The nasi lemak was satisfying, with fragrant rice, crispy chicken, and egg that complemented each other well. However, the sambal could use some improvement as it tasted a bit plain. Same goes with fries anchovies a bit too salty.

The pancake had a decent presentation but lacked flavor.

the first one (5 min) sejuk. Sangat sejuk sampai boleh pegang dengan jari.

second one mmg dtg panas2. Yang bit funny waitress dia mengaku makanan first tu mmg dah siap and tinggal serve. While others yang we order baru goreng.

Waiter dah bgtau owner and chef but they buat donno je mcm its okay. Sorry but sorry its not okay.   but we eat jelah sbb come from johor and lapar.

Takde pun offer utk ganti new food or what. Very bad service.

Then i order grilled chicken rm18, coeslaw datang togel tanpa sauce. Rasa tawar and very basic.

I should take look deeper on the review before makan, tapi yelah kita melancong kan. Dalam portal cakap best food in ganu lol.

"The cafe is clean and quite comfortable to sit and lepak. Service time also quite fast, and the staff were okay .. they answered my questions properly.

Ayam Penyet (Signature)
Honestly, this one not really penyet. The chicken came as crispy fried chicken, not smashed at all. The chicken was okay la, well-cooked, but a bit dry for crispy chicken. Portion of tauhu was very little, and they even put long beans .. which is quite unusual for nasi penyet. But I really liked the soup. It's not the usual plain bland soup; this one had strong chicken flavour with sweet spices, very unique. For me, the only mistake is the chicken... it felt more like nasi ayam crispy than ayam penyet.

Nasi Ayam Buttermilk (Signature)
Chicken cooked well, batter thick. But the taste was too heavy on the butter. No hint of curry or sweet flavour like some buttermilk chicken I've tried before. It was just salty and buttery all the way. Portion size was big though, so can be filling.

Tiramisu
This one not so impressive. The biscuit layer was mushy and a bit dry at the same time ... macam over-soaked but not in a nice way. Coffee taste also hilang, almost not there. Cream was heavy and lacked the slight tang you usually get in tiramisu. Presentation was okay since it came in a cup, but flavour wise, can improve a lot.

"Was having some pregnancy-induced craving for takoyaki. Came and I got four takoyaki which weren't smooth surfaced - I instantly knew they weren't right. At first bite, yes the crispy envelope was there, but that's where the joy ended. The takoyaki batter itself was too thick, it felt like eating spherical mashed potato. The brown sauce felt like that zing that usually comes from Worcestershire sauce was scarce. Good takoyaki should be gooey on the inside and rather light on the palate but here it's really heavy

We had chawanmushi too. The egg custard itself was alright, not overcooked, not too eggy which is good, but I came to wonder why were the shredded kani sprinkled on top rather than mostly sunken in the chawanmushi itself. And that sliced cucumber untouched by the custard... Really didn't make sense both taste and aesthetic-wise

Decided to try unagi nigirizushi to really appreciate the taste of the rice. Sushi rice was not packed tightly enough. The unagi was missing its trademark smoky fishy taste

Finally, we had ebiten uramakizushi. I think this final plate was the one that saved the rest of the dishes. It was just nice - not too much of rice. Tempura batter light and crispy, prawn itself was so-so but I'm not going to be fussy about it because personally for someone from Klang Valley, I find that it's quite cheap

I'm unsure if the dishes are made in such a way to suit the local palate but for people who are used to eating Japanese food, we'd be rather flat to have them. The deco was too dark and depressing. The restaurant sign was really washed out. The acoustic and ventilation were a nightmare for me since I am claustrophobic, but in Terengganu, I didn't have much choice. Nonetheless, service was prompt, courteous, and friendly

All in all I think the restaurant has some potential. Maybe putting someone with a more vibrant mind in charge to make some changes while this sector is still rather unchallenged in Terengganu",FALSE

 I had the sweet and sour chicken rice here today. From the first bite, I noticed something was off with the sauce's flavor. I initially brushed it off, thinking it was just the restaurant's unique recipe. As I was finishing my meal, I saved the tomato for last and discovered it had sour, spoiled smell. My friend and I both agreed the tomato had gone bad. When I brought it to the owner's attention, she said it was just overripe. Although she offered to make a new dish for me, but I was almost done with my meal so I declined. Hopefully the restaurant will pay more attention to the freshness of their ingredients to prevent this from happening again.",FALSE

If you're in search of an affordable dining option with a wide variety of choices, this Thai restaurant located right next to the primary school could be worth considering.

They offer individual meals and an array of dishes, including Thai cuisine and Chinese-style cze cha (Zhu Chao).

The tom yum soup had a universal level of sourness and spiciness. However, the Pad Thai was excessively moist and clumped together, making it difficult to enjoy. Similarly, the seafood fried rice lacked flavour and was overly moist too.

After the meal, my family and I felt heavy on our tummy. 

It's worth noting that indoor seating is limited and most tables are outdoors, so be prepared for mosquitoes. ",FALSE

"Tie Ban Dou Fu Signature Hot Plate Beancurd = RM14.90
Cui Pi Ya Vegetarian Crispy Duck = RM15.90
No Service Charge

For Strict Vegans, you might want to take note that this place serves Eggs.

This was quite a Big Place, Air-Conditioned but not very cold.
The Hot Plate Beancurd took 9 Mins, and the Vegetarian Crispy Duck took 10 Mins. Everything was served up in 10 Mins. Acceptable Timing I suppose.

Tie Ban Dou Fu Signature Hot Plate Beancurd = RM14.90

When this was served up, the first thing I smelt was the Savoury Delicious Smell of Bell Pepper pieces which really whet my appetite and very Kai Wei.

This was a Very Big Plate and I counted at least over 20 Pieces of Egg Tofu. Soft to the Bite and Creamy Smooth, they're Very Lovely to eat and I feel are almost no different compared to Normal Non-Vegetarian Versions.

The Bottom of the Pan is a Layer of Egg Omelette with Many Slices of either Shitake or Button Mushrooms together with Slices of Vegetarian Fishcakes.

The Soul of this Dish is Definitely the Gravy. Beautifully Hot and Smooth, it tastes Very Savoury without any Taste of Vegetarian Oyster Sauce which I don't like about Vegetarian Dishes. This Gravy is the Glue that held everything together. Not Overly Salty, this would be very nice to Xia Fan with.

Cui Pi Ya Vegetarian Crispy Duck = RM15.90

This Dish is not listed as their Recommended Dishes on the Menu but I ordered it because it is Quite Highly Raved by Google Map Reviewers.

When this was served up, I was impressed by its Presentation. Looks really nice with the Generous Amounts of ""Duck Meats"". The Gravy has a Very Mild Plum Flavour and is Slightly Sweetish.
The ""Duck"" is obviously made out of Beancurd, and i must say it ALMOST taste like Meat. This is the Closest Approximation of Meat I have tasted so far for a Vegetarian Eatery in JB.

The Bite Texture was what surprised me. Within its Mostly Soft Chew Upper Layer, there is an Actual Slight Crunch Bite within. This means they Panfried and Sizzled the Sheet of Beancurd before they plate it up and lum the sauce. I appreciate the Extra Effort. I guess they were not wrong in naming this dish as ""Crispy Duck""

That said, there is a Major Flaw in this Dish. That is the Amount of Plum Sauce is a Tad Over Excessive. Even Real Non-Vegan Roast Duck also don't lum so much Sauce.

Perhaps offer the Gravy on the Side for Customers to ownself lum or dip the pieces in would be better? This will help keep the Crispiness longer and make the ""Duck"" less Nua Nua.

Conclusion and Closing Thoughts

RM14.90 (S$4.30) for such a Big Generous Plate of Hotplate Tofu was Absolutely Worth the Money. There are enough here to Comfortably feed 2-3 People. It tasted so good, that I feel even People who don't eat Vegetarian often will also enjoy this. This Dish would pair very Beautifully with some Rice or Noodles.

RM15.90 (S$4.60) for that Vegetarian Crispy Duck I feel may not be worth the Value for some People. Because if you break it down to its Bare Components, it is basically a Sheet of Beancurd with Plum Sauce after all.

I personally feel it is worth the money because there is Quite Alot of Thought that has gone into its Design and there are some Culinary Effort made to it that I appreciated. (Especially appreciate the Effort they did to Pre-Panfry to ensure a Crisp Bite)

The Main Issue I have with this place though is that it is not Very Solo Friendly. All of their Dishes are Very Big Portion even though they're listed as ""Small"" on the Menu. They also weren't flexible enough to offer to make a Solo Version and reduce the price accordingly.

Anyway, if you are looking for a Vegetarian Eatery that showcases both Creativity and Culinary Effort in their Dishes, I can recommend this place to try.

I went to buy lunch today. As the person packing the food gave a good portion of food packed. But the person in counter (also the staff)right in front of me telling off the other worker asking the packing guy to go and reduce all the food portion that was already packed by the worker.  Despite charging rm20 for less portion you gave me less portion. I  always come here to buy my lunch and most of times my breakfast and giving this attitude to your loyal customers aren't really good. We have many other restaurants around to go in desa Cemerlang so you must understand why customers are loyal to you.

Seating is flexible, with both square
and rectangular tables indoors and outdoors, making it suitable for
casual meals with family or friends.

The team behind Someday is family-oriented and it shows
--service is warm, proactive,
and attentive, giving the place a
grounded sense of hospitality.

The menu itself is wide-ranging,
from eastern comfort food to
western staples.

While the variety is commendable,
such breadth can sometimes
stretch the kitchen operations thin,
resulting in inconsistencies in taste
and plating.

Portions are decent and pricing sits
in the mid-range, but there is room
for refinement in food quality and
flavor balance to truly match the thoughtful service.

Someday is a pleasant dining stop
for those looking for variety under
one roof, but with some tightening
of its culinary focus, it could become
even more memorable.

"Dining out is often more than just satisfying hunger; it can be an experience that delights all the senses. This was certainly the case when I visited Mei Jing Majestic Scene Restaurant, a dining establishment renowned for its breathtaking views, exquisite cuisine, and impeccable service. The evening I spent there was nothing short of magical, leaving me with memories that I will cherish for a long time.

The first thing that struck me upon entering Mei Jing Majestic Scene Restaurant was its stunning location. Perched atop a hill overlooking a serene lake, the restaurant offers panoramic views of the surrounding landscape. As the sun set, casting a golden hue over the water, I could not help but feel a sense of tranquility and awe. The interior of the restaurant mirrored its natural surroundings, with large windows, elegant decor, and a warm, inviting ambiance.

The menu at Mei Jing Majestic Scene Restaurant is a testament to culinary artistry. Each dish is carefully crafted using the finest ingredients, blending traditional flavors with contemporary techniques. I began my meal with a starter of fresh spring rolls, delicately wrapped and bursting with crisp vegetables and succulent shrimp. The accompanying dipping sauce added a perfect balance of sweetness and tanginess, enhancing the flavors without overpowering them.

For the main course, I opted for the chef's special: a slow-cooked duck served with a rich plum sauce. The duck was cooked to perfection, tender and moist, with the plum sauce providing a delightful contrast of sweet and savory. The dish was accompanied by a side of sauteed greens and fragrant jasmine rice, each element complementing the other to create a harmonious symphony of flavors.

Dessert was a highlight of the evening, with a beautifully presented mango pudding that was almost too pretty to eat. The pudding was light and creamy, with the natural sweetness of the mango shining through. A drizzle of coconut milk and a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds added depth and texture to the dish, making it a perfect ending to a memorable meal.

Beyond the exceptional food and picturesque setting, what truly set my experience at Mei Jing Majestic Scene Restaurant apart was the outstanding service. From the moment I arrived, the staff were attentive and courteous, anticipating my needs without being intrusive. They were knowledgeable about the menu and eager to provide recommendations, ensuring that my dining experience was as enjoyable as possible. Their genuine warmth and professionalism made me feel welcome and valued as a guest.

As I sat back and sipped on a cup of fragrant green tea, I reflected on the evening. Mei Jing Majestic Scene Restaurant had provided me with more than just a meal; it had given me an experience that engaged all my senses and left me feeling rejuvenated. The combination of delectable cuisine, stunning views, and impeccable service created a dining experience that was truly extraordinary.

In conclusion, Mei Jing Majestic Scene Restaurant lives up to its name in every way. It offers a majestic dining experience that combines the best of nature, culinary excellence, and hospitality. Whether you are looking for a romantic dinner, a special celebration, or simply a place to unwind and enjoy good food, this restaurant is sure to exceed your expectations. My visit to Mei Jing Majestic Scene Restaurant was a testament to the power of exceptional dining experiences, and I look forward to returning to relive the magic once more.",FALSE

Totally did not disappoint. The yam basket is very nostalgic, sharing a happy feeling when you get to see it again. It's just that it's too big, not possible to finish lol.

The food is reasonable price for it's portion, however, taste wise is just normal.
1. Mee Rebus (RM7) - The noodles and biscuit given are kinda hard.
2. Laksa Cockles (RM8) - The soup base is fragrant and thick. More like Curry Laksa taste.

I wouldn't say the food here is very nice, but it's an old kopitiam that uncles and aunties would hang around often. It's their neighborhood kopitiam.

The workers are friendly, but takes quite a long time to prepare the food. They just did renovation recently, therefore the name of this kopitiam is different from their signboard and in Google. I did attached their kopitiam new signboard below. Hope it helps.",FALSE

Restoran Wan Li Siang is a local
kopitiam that has expanded from a
single shoplot into three, bustling with
the heartwarming energy of everyday life.

It's one of the rare places where you can find street food from all three major ethnic groups under one roof--a vibrant microcosm of Malaysia's multicultural soul.

More than just a hawker hotspot, this space reflects the enduring spirit of street vendors and their connection to the surrounding community.

Special thanks to Cheng Gor's Wanton Noodle stall, who kindly prepared a vegetarian version for my family and only charged RM3 per bowl.

This generosity, without fuss or show,
is the true essence of the hawker spirit
--something to be respected and remembered.

A pleasant surprise here is a Western
food stall that not only delivers creative dishes, but also plates them on proper ceramic dishes--balancing both flair and sincerity.

We were especially grateful they accommodated a chicken-free Mac & Cheese, making dietary choices feel respected and welcomed.

You might also spot a beverage counter whose signage bears a humorous resemblance to a certain global brand.

It's a playful, local twist--blending familiarity with grassroots creativity.

All in all, Wan Li Siang isn't just a place to eat. It's a living tableau of local flavours, cultural coexistence, and the gentle warmth of a street corner that remembers your preferences.

"Saya pergi petang semalam, 2/5/2025 around 6pm.

Makanan:
1. Set sup tulang + daging, daging empuk. Sup bukan tipikal sup utara which is for us memang sedap & tak muak. Cuma tulang tu better masak lebih lama dengan api slow, sebab daging di tulang tu agak liat & susah nak dicobek/cabut dari tulang.

2. Nasi goreng udang + sotong, sambal yang udang sotong tu sumpah sedap, tapi tak pedas so sesuai untuk budak2 & orang tua jugak. Nasi rasanya balance, tapi terlebih minyak so agak muak bila makan banyak. Udang elok tak terlajak masak. Sotong pun okay tak liat, cuma ""mulut"" sotong tu tak dibuang, mulut dia tu agak tajam sebenarnya.

3. Kopi 'o' memang padu, waktu awal2 sampai tu berasap2, perghhh...cuma saya tak berjaya habiskan sebab perut dah sendat dengan makanan...maaf ya tuan kedai.
Portion makanan memang besar ye, puas hati berbaloi.

Servis:
Servis mantap. Laju je air & makanan sampai. Yang terbaiknya, saya whatsapp sebelum pergi, laju je dapat reply. Bukan tu je, dia siap tanya lagi saya dah sampai ke belum sebab last order 6.30pm. Tapi maaf, saya tak perasan chat & lupa inform. +- jam 6.40pm tu baru saya reply...kami dah settle makan pun time tu
Servis memang tiptop lah.

Persekitaran:
Well actually nyaman & lawa je, lagi2 time panas & padi penuh sawah, cuma saya pergi tu tiba2 hujan lebat yang amat sangat...redha je la kena tempias padahal dah duduk di tengah2.
Sejuk gila weh...dah la duduk depan kipas...hujan pulak tu...beku...

"Singgah makan disini untuk balik kg ke Sabak Bernam. Overall untuk pilihan menu, banyak dan pelbagai. Set makan tengahari yg mudah dipilih, masakan panas pun ada and ada menu western.

First time jumpa kedai yg ada pelbagai jugak menu berasaskan roti. Jadi, kalau tak nak makan heavy2, banyak makanan light2 boleh kita pilih. Saya order nasi chicken buttermilk, nasi goreng ayam, abc, waffle and kambing bakar. Sos kambing bakar tu manis pedas2 tapi mcm sos black pepper biasa je. Cuma harga ye murah untuk portion sebegitu. Nasi goreng okay lah cuma kalau dpt panas sikit, rasanya better kot sbb dpt macam agak sejuk sikit. Ayam buttermilk tu bnyak and lembut. Portion sesuai dgn harga.
ABC dkt sini wajib cuba kot. Haha sbb tinggi ye ais shave ye hahaha. Ais ye mmg hancur and even my son pun suka.
I think kalau kedai ni dekat dgn rumah, boleh pergi hari hari untuk cuba menu yg lain. Staff pun ramai and mesra pelanggan. Order pun xdelah lama tunggu. Sekejap je.

With a bit skeptical by the outlook of the restaurant, we walked in and placed our orders. It looked like the restaurant was operating on a one man show but later found out from the owner that his staff was on emergency and that's why he ran the restaurant on his own.

The mushroom soup was served first. It was tasty but not too extraordinary. However when the pork chop was served, we were surprised with the thick cut and the tasty of it. It was heavenly. The last one even better. The pork ribs was definitely more delicious than what you have in Morganfield. The price made it even better, the ribs cost only RM28.90!

"Repeat came here after our first experienced previously was not good, due to food serve taste bad.

Considered this is our first time after they reopened the restaurant. We ordered lamb sizzling and they served us with burnt and overcooked lamb (refer photo). However, the sauce is good. Coleslaw cut too big. Maybe they can improve on that.

Sitting tables are a lot, you can sit inside our outside the restaurant. However parking is limited.

We ordered mushroom soup, but they served taste like chicken soup with adding mushroom.
Very salty but soup is thick.
Sink and toilet available inside the restaurant.

Waiting time to get drink takes around 5minutes, which is quite fast. Food serve less than 15minutes.

"Sekeping Serendah
10 September 1 night instant booking and stay. Chalet Glass Shed 2. 4pax rm500 additional 1pax rm50 and extra charcoal rm10. Had to pay cash as the minimum time for reservation is 48hour. Easy.

Booked via its own website. All room prices are standard, clear description of chalets and clear/ample instructions provided for the stay. I brought towels. Personal hygiene, clothes and food. Light packing only. Stairs quite steep and narrow to get into the chalet and upstairs bedroom, so i dont recommend kids or elderly unless they are really fit.

Amazing view the moment we entered its compound. Gated and guarded by its care taker. Quiet. Only 3 units occupied so surroundings seemed secluded and niceeee.
Caretaker helped with a bit of luggage (thank you)provide instructions for the unit and  map of the estate. Offered to setup bbq pit which he did at 7pm before he is off duty that night. No cell network, but wifi is good enough to make calls in case of emergency and some web surfing/messaging.

5 of us girls night out has been so much fun, bonding time was great because no cell service 'forced' us to sit and talk and bond. Unit space is just right size and comfortable for girls slumber party kampung style. I loved every moment, being a 47year old with young adult daughters and their friends, i appreciate this jungle homes as an alternative to city hotels theme park quick getaways. Even one of the girls kept on washing dishes, volunteer to cook and clean, because she said nothing else to do without internet.  That is how much this place made her feel. Alived and present!
This chalet surrounded by glass amazing view and ambience. Not overwhelming at all. Surprisingly, not much bugs considering we were in the middle of a jungle. Place is clean and we kept all rubbish in the bin closed. Windows and doors closed by 7pm and we lit uo few mosquito coils just to be safe.

Slept well. With mosquito net, repellant i had a good sleep. Woke up at 6am, had coffee then for morning walk. They have few walking tracks for guests to walkaround the estate. 2 swimming pools and water was great. It was raining and i still went in for a lap or two because it was too nice to pass up.

The unit has a wok, double gas stove, toast maker, water kettle, mugs,plates, utensils for light cooking.. we made maggi goreng with bbq chicken and hot milo/nescafe. It rains heavily again that night, but we felt safe and continue with card games charades etc till late.

Checkout was easy. We cleaned up the unit and caretaker came to pickup the key right on time 12pm.

All in all. WORTH EVERY BIT OF MY RINGGIT for a quick getaway from city living. Would come back more often.",FALSE
"Feels like Tarzan & Jane. Beautiful and peaceful retreat just 45mins away from bustling KL. Monkeys can be seen from your own room. Super geil! Swimming pools were out of this world. Tranquil retreat. Never a bad idea to be here. Nevermind the weather. All weather is good. And the outdoor shower is super nice. And the toilet, amazing, real life HD. You may even have a monkey looking at you while you doing your business. Staffs were very helpful. Helped us with the things to the room and setting up our bbq at our balcony.

"Stayed here for a night in warehouse 1 for my mother's birthday, recommended if you're nature lover, expecting a unique stay. However, facilities , room condition and service wise, deteriorates terribly

Worker named gurungan extremely unfriendly, open the gate for us and just said ""pergi atas saje' no proper instructions, we end search our own place. Very pushy on selling charcoal for barbecue despite explaining to him I'm not going to do use any heavy meats, just marshmallows. End up giving broken rusted tongs, end up using hands to adjust charcoal by myself.
However the other worker has more friendly gesture

Room wise, I could feel the bed springs when lay down  no basic bottled water/soap/towel served despite quoting higher price RM1500+ per night, could improve on that.
The pool was major disappointment as well, no proper maintenance.

2 stars for the great view and environment ",FALSE

"During our stay at Sekeping Serendah, we experienced the devastating loss of our beloved dog and he was family to us. The management's response to our tragedy was both dismissive and lacking in empathy.

Our dog was in good health and just had his medical check, which made this sudden loss even more inexplicable and painful. He exhibited signs of poisoning and suffered seizures before passing away. Their primary defence was that no dangerous substances or chemicals were present on the premises and no other pet 'mishaps' happened. However, this does not diminish the fact that we lost our dog on their property. Their response did little to none to acknowledge or address the issue. The other pets were staying in different areas and walked different routes, does it need to take more than one tragic incident for them to take action? It's as though they were implying that the death of a dog isn't significant enough to warrant action.

The remote location of Sekeping Serendah is part of its charm, as it is nestled in a tranquil forest. However, this also means that getting in and out of the village to the main road takes about 15-20 minutes, via dark narrow roads, making it inconvenient to access medical help. We lost our dog while rushing him to the hospital, and nothing much could be done.

This heartbreaking experience has cast a shadow over what was meant to be a joyous time. I hope the management will take this incident seriously and work towards ensuring such tragedies do not happen to other pet owners in the future.

If I could, I'd give them 0 stars for their poor incident and customer relations management. I will never return.",FALSE

It boasted a wonderfully creamy and incredibly fragrant curry gravy, perfectly complementing the huge and fresh prawns. Each prawn was cooked to perfection, remaining juicy and tender, and there were a generous 10-12 pieces in the pot - excellent value!
We also tried the fish head curry with vegetables, which offered a slightly spicier kick. This gravy was rich and flavorful, packed with cabbage, lady's fingers, and tofu bean curd. It paired absolutely perfectly with rice, making for a hearty and delicious combination.
Overall, the food here is consistently generously portioned and simply good. The atmosphere is akin to having lunch at a house, and despite the warm weather, it wasn't uncomfortably hot thanks to the abundance of fans. WK Restaurant is a solid choice for a delicious and comforting meal.",FALSE

"This is the worst Pizza Hut branch to ever exist...

1.Customer Service is atrocious.They don't even entertain you even if you're standing at the counter to make your orders or to collect your orders.They don't greet you.They just don't see you at all.Somehow you're just non existent.

2.Not once but so many times they gave me burnt pizza..I'll attach the Picture below..

3.They don't call and update you if the order is ready or not for (online orders).

Please hire workers who can actually work and give them proper training on basic hospitality -- teaching staff to greet customers warmly, confirm orders clearly, and double-check before serving.

Customers expect their orders to be correct the first time, especially when they are paying good money. Mistakes not only waste time but also damage trust and satisfaction.

The vibe is always busy and energetic, especially at night, so service can be a little slow during peak hours. Parking around the area can also be tricky when it's crowded. Still, the staff are generally friendly and food arrives fairly quick once ordered.

"This place is absolutely amazing and has quickly become one of my family's favorite dining spots. The restaurant itself is spacious, with plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors. The indoor air-conditioned section can feel a little too cold for my liking, so we usually opt to sit outdoors.

The food here is consistently delicious, and every visit has been a satisfying experience. They offer an impressive variety of fresh seafood such as fish, crab, lobster, shellfish, and more. While the prices, particularly for items like fish and prawns, are on the higher side, the freshness and quality absolutely justify the cost.

The fish is always served fresh and nicely cooked. The dish that stands out the most to me is their homemade fried tofu topped with crispy vegetables. Honestly, every dish we've tried here has been of good standards. The Coconut Pudding dessert was so good, we had to bring one home for family to try.

The service is good too. The staff are attentive and professional. Definitely a hidden gem worth going out of your way for. If you're looking for a gastronomical seafood dining experience, I highly recommend it. My family and I will definitely continue returning!",FALSE

Nasi Lemak Ayam Berempah- sedap betul. Ayam tak keras, rangup di luar. Dia ada letak serbuk ke serunding tak pasti, tapi benda tu sedap dan unik. Combination semua dalam pinggan tu ngam.
Nasi Ayam Lemon- sedap betul! Ini memang speciality Pakli kopitiam.
Bubur Ayam- sedap sangat! Harap portion boleh up sikit. Sapa sapa demam atau rasa nak makan bubur, sila order bubur ayam pakli.
Spaghetti Bolognese- sedap!
Kuew tiau goreng- sedap!
Chicken Chop Hainan/sweet and sour sauce- kurang memuaskan. Ayam tu macam tasteless sikit. Kuah tu pula tak kena dengan chicken chop. Better tukar kuah tu kepada black pepper sauce.
Nasi Goreng Cina- sedap betul! Sapa tak suka pedas atau nak bagi kanak-kanak makan, sesuai.

"Assalamualaikum Boss Lan,

Pertama sekali, tahniah dan terima kasih sebab kekalkan rasa original Nasi Kandar Melayu Kedah yang susah nak cari kat area Selangor ni. Saya sendiri memang suka makan kat sini sebab rasa dia 'lain macam', memang padu!

Cuma hari ni saya nak berkongsi sikit pandangan ikhlas sebagai pelanggan tetap dan pencinta nasi kandar.

1. Isu Pekerja (Time Puncak)
Tadi masa peak hour, hanya satu staff sahaja yang jaga kaunter depan dan pada masa yang sama kena lari ke belakang untuk buat air. Nampak sangat penat dia. Kalau ada sorang dua staff tambahan masa waktu puncak, insyaAllah servis boleh jadi lebih lancar dan pelanggan pun tak tunggu lama.

2. Staff Sampai Lambat & Merokok Dekat depan Pelanggan
Saya perasan ada staff yang sampai agak lewat dan terus duduk merokok dekat sebelah meja depan restoran, dekat dengan pelanggan yang tengah makan. Ni agak tak selesa, Boss. Mungkin boleh letakkan ruang khas staff merokok di tempat yang lebih sesuai.

3. Kebersihan Meja & Table Clearance
Banyak meja yang tak sempat dibersihkan, sampai kami yang bantu clear meja sendiri. Saya faham mungkin staff tak cukup masa tu, tapi ni akan bagi imej kurang baik kalau first-time customer datang.

4. Paip Cuci Tangan Kat Belakang
Paip cuci tangan yang dikongsi kat kaunter minuman tu saya rasa kurang sesuai. Ada yang berkumur dan meludah kat sink tu. Untuk kebersihan dan keselesaan pelanggan, mungkin boleh pertimbang untuk baiki satu sink di depan tu untuk cuci tangan.

5. Sikap Staff - 'Lepak Mode' Bila Tak Sibuk
Waktu takde pelanggan beratur, ada staff yang lepak merokok depan restoran. Mungkin Boss boleh remind sikit team supaya jaga imej restoran walaupun masa tu tak sibuk. Benda kecil, tapi boleh buat pelanggan rasa lebih yakin nak datang balik.

Saya bagi pandangan ni bukan nak mengata, tapi sebab saya sayang tempat ni dan nak tengok restoran Boss makin maju. Lan Kedah ada potensi besar - rasa makanan dah A+, cuma perlu kemaskan sikit bab servis dan pengurusan pelanggan.

InsyaAllah, kalau semua ni diperbaiki, confirm customer akan repeat lagi dan lagi.

Terima kasih Boss, semoga terus berjaya",FALSE

recomendation to improve: hope staff can be a bit friendly, the sotong price need to be a bit cheaper, the food station need to have food heater like other kedai mamak(because my food is quite cold but i am eating at home so i reheat it back) and install fly lamp(due to i see some fly flying around the premise).",FALSE

"We visited The Makan Kitchen (located on Level 1, if I'm not mistaken) for a buffet dinner. Honestly, it was quite a random choice, but I made a reservation for 3 pax.

The spread was impressive, offering a mix of Indian, Chinese, Western, and Malay cuisines. Some dishes were delicious while others could definitely be improved. The highlight of the buffet, without a doubt, was the fresh oysters  -- so fresh, so flavorful, and surprisingly, they didn't trigger my seafood allergies, which was amazing!

There were plenty of options overall, and the ambiance was cozy. However, service could be better. Staff should be more attentive in clearing plates, especially since this is rated as Shah Alam's No.1 5-star hotel on Trip.com. Another major downside was the raw salmon tom yum (I can't recall the exact name) -- unfortunately, it tasted awful and really didn't work.

Other than that, most of the dishes were tasty and enjoyable. I just hope that management takes these points seriously for improvement, because at a 5-star hotel, the standard should be higher. If it were a 3-star hotel, I probably wouldn't complain as much. Overall, a good experience with lots of potential to be even better....",FALSE
"Was expecting a buffet dinner with many dishes, but it turned out otherwise -- limited choices in each section, for example Indian, Chinese, or Malay food. Only two cold drinks were available (lemon tea ice and lemon ice), and no soft drinks were provided. Most of the seafood was either spicy or raw, so we couldn't enjoy much.

The most delicious dish was the Shell Out, but unfortunately it was served too late, and by then we were already full, so we couldn't eat much -- it should have been served earlier.

The location is good -- right next to Central I-City Mall and opposite I-City Theme Park, which is very convenient. Parking inside the hotel is a flat rate of RM10, but you must validate the parking ticket at the counter before exiting.

For the buffet price, I don't think it matched the value.",FALSE

"Had dinner at Serai Thai, Seksyen 3, Shah Alam and would rate it around 2.5/5. Overall, the meal was underwhelming with little to entice a return.Tom Yum: The broth lacked depth, the paste wasn't robust, while the lime and coriander notes were overly pronounced, masking the essential tom yum balance. Kailan Ikan Masin: The dish was weighed down by excessive starch, resulting in an unappealing, gloopy sauce where the signature salted fish flavour was virtually absent. Crab Meat Omelette: Disappointingly ordinary, resembling a standard omelette with only sparse bits of crab leg, offering no real lift in flavour. Salted Egg Squid: Failed to deliver the addictive richness one expects; the coating was flat and lacked that satisfying sweet-savoury punch. On top of that, being charged for the ""complimentary"" tidbits left a sour impression. It felt misleading and added to the overall dissatisfaction.",FALSE

While the steamed seabass didn't quite meet expectations this round, it was too soured with no umami taste and sugary - little underwhelming in comparison to their usual standard -- the overall meal still hit the spot.

"12/07/2025 - 6:45pm

Venue: Romantic Dinner night with my Girlfriend (GF)
Food: ""Fusili Al Pesto"", couple sharing setup
Drink: Orange Juice, Mango Iced Tea, Pellegrino Sparkling

Story:
We arrived at the place around 6:45pm, and upon reaching there, was greeted by Mr Zul, our lovely and friendly waiter of the night.
I requested for a couple seating in which he showed us to the farthest one, near the window for privacy and also the great view! (There's only 3 couple tables).
Mr Zul, setup our table, and handed us the menu to us, and we both ordered as per above.

I then, specifically inquired Mr Zul, that i wanted  to light up my own candlelight which i bring along, and he said it was ok to do so.
Now, the perfect candlelight dinner was complete!

Mr Zul later on come back to us with a free on the house, bread with olive oil & tomato garnish.
The bread coupled with the tomato garnish was delicious by the way.
You can taste the perfect sourness of tomato, like it was freshly made from the kitchen!

Mr Zul then served us our pasta, since we don't want a heavy dinner, and my GF don't eat that much anyway.
The pasta portion was enough for at least 2pax though.

We opted for a couple sharing setup, pasta, and took a bite from the plate.
The fusili pasta was great! Al dente just as we love it!
The basil was also on point, which was not too overbearing, and also had just enough cheese in it.

Shortly after serving us the pasta, Mr Zul inquire us if we would like plain water or spakling, for which i requested sparkling.
It definetely quenches our thirst, and along with our other drinks, our palate for the night was satisfied!

Mr Zul would come by from time to time to ask us about the food, and whether we would like to add any order. Attentive fella i tell ya!

The view was amazing! I would say, and with the background overlooking the iCity Ferris Wheel & Waterslide, it was a beautiful array of colors lighting up!

I asked my GF for a photo portrait shoot.
And the staff also helped us in taking a few shots as well, and i couldnt stressed out that the picture was amazingly lovely with the both of us!

Upon getting back to our seats, Mr Farhan, the floor supervisor, surprised the both of us with another free on the house, mango pudding desert!
And do i say that the taste was amazingly sweet!
You can taste the sweetness of the mango, like freshly made ones, and was definetely matched with the strawberries and blueberries accompanying it.

All in all, it was a lovely night to be remembered for the both of us! We will definetely look back and remember this in our hearts !

Shout out to Mr Zul for the attentive, impeccable and personalised service given, and did i mention the lovely personality too !
As well, as to Mr Farhan and all the other staff for the support that they have given to us.

I would definetely come here again to repeat back my experience in the future.
I rate this place 10/10.
Totally recommended!",FALSE

Btw kopi dia pun sedap gak Dan harga berpatutan jugak. Kek dia pun sedap Dan berpatutan dgn harga.

The staff were full of smiles and hospitality, and made our family feel very comfortable in the space.

"Hi Wong Solo Management,

I've been a loyal customer for many years, and I've always appreciated your food and service. But I had a really frustrating experience tonight that I feel needs to be shared.

I understand your outlet closes at 10pm, with last call at 9.30pm. I arrived exactly at 9.30pm, but the staff and your PIC refused to take my takeaway order. I was told they follow the time on their phone, even though the store signage clearly shows 9.30pm as the last call  which I was on time for. (Before I snap the pic)

It felt like they were more eager to close early than serve a customer who made the effort to come on time. I understand staff may want to finish up, but this is not the right way to treat loyal customers.

Really hope you can look into this. Consistency in your service and respect for your customers' time matters.",FALSE

"Honest Review:
This shop has a wide variety of food such as BBQ, cendol, mixed rice, waffles, and more. The taste is nice, but the biggest issue is that all the food is left uncovered, attracting many flies.

The staff's attitude is also very rude. As a first-time customer, it's normal to ask where they keep the plates, spoons, waffle butter, etc., but when I asked, the staff simply replied, ""Don't have, finished."" So what does that mean? Should I go into the kitchen to clean the spoon myself, refill the peanut butter for customers, or even bring my own from home? They didn't even bother to assist customers, which is nonsense.

While I was still eating around 10 PM, one of the staff purposely told me, ""We need to clean because it's almost 11 PM and we want to close."" He even asked me to rush and finish my food, even though there were still many customers eating at that time. That is extremely rude, especially when we have already paid for the food.

I'm very disappointed with the staff's attitude, as if they were never taught how to serve customers properly. This was my last visit I will never come again.",FALSE

"I recently dined at this  restaurant and, unfortunately, it was a disappointing experience. I ordered the lamb and chicken Mandi/Kabsa, Kunafa, and Mango Lassi, but the quality was far below expectations.

The rice was extremely dry, making it unpleasant to eat. The meat lacked moisture and flavor, and the salatah was overly sour. To top it off, the Mango Lassi didn't even taste like Mango Lassi--it was completely off.

For the price I paid, the quality was simply not worth it. This place used to be good, but sadly, that's no longer the case. I really hope they improve their food so future customers don't have to go through the same disappointment.",FALSE

The staff here are exceptionally friendly and attentive, ensuring a warm and welcoming dining experience. Whether you're a regular or a first-timer, they make you feel right at home. To explore the variety, we decided to try a couple of different naan flavors, each uniquely delicious and expertly crafted.

Unfortunately, I didn't feel it was worth the price. We ordered the lamb mess and the lemon shrimp scampi pasta. Sadly, the pasta was bland--I couldn't taste any garlic or butter, and it needed extra black pepper just to give it some flavor. The shrimp didn't taste fresh, and parts of the pasta were either overcooked or undercooked. The lamb mess was acceptable, but I've had better elsewhere. The open kitchen was a little unsettling--I even saw staff handling and chewing on food, which didn't feel appropriate for a cafe.

"I was drawn to this cafe by their unique offering; Peruvian Chicken. It was a long trek to get there but it was certainly worth the effort.

To start, their Mushroom Soup was thick, creamy and had chunks of chopped mushrooms in it. You could taste the made from scratch goodness of this soup. Served with a dash of olive oil on top and a house made focaccia bread slice on the side, this was truly tasty and gets a Highly Recommended.

The Peruvian Chicken was a well marinated whole spring chicken. Tender and juicy inside with a crispy and flavourful skin, this is worthy of being their signature dish. A green sauce (Aji Verde) is served with the chicken and it was slightly spicy from green chillies I suspect. It paired very well with the chicken. The dish came with a generous serving of potatoes with onions and this could easily be shared by two small eaters. This dish gets a Highly Recommended as well.

The Beef Chimichurri Sandwich on the other hand was a little under-seasoned. I felt the Chimichurri sauce would have benefitted from some extra salt. The beef was good quality and tender. The ciabatta bread was perhaps a little oily too. The sandwich came with a tomato soup on the side. You can spoon some of the soup into the sandwich or dunk the sandwich into the soup. Or you could just have the soup separately.

For dessert, the Espresso Creme Brulee Toast was spot on. A crispy French toast doused with an espresso shot and topped with a scoop of ice cream and sprinkled with toasted almond slivers. This is Highly Recommended as well.

"1 Pork Stomach Soup - 4/10
The broth was mild, lacking the deep, peppery warmth that makes this dish comforting. The pork stomach itself was tender but didn't absorb much flavor, making it rather plain.

2 Thai Laksa - 2/10
Originally ordered Asam Laksa, and they acknowledged my order. However, upon pickup, I was given Thai Laksa instead. When I asked, they simply said Asam Laksa was unavailable and only Thai Laksa was being prepared.

Taste-wise, it was quite disappointing. The broth lacked depth, missing the balance of spiciness, tanginess, and creaminess that a good Thai Laksa should have. The coconut milk flavor was weak, the seasoning felt off, and the noodles were slightly overcooked, making the texture less enjoyable. Overall, it tasted flat and uninspiring.

 Service/Response - 3/10
They should have informed me in advance about the menu change instead of just swapping the dish without notice.

 Total Cost: RM20.50

Omg . we love this place. Surprisingly soo cheap. Love the char Siu which is 90% lean and tasty....on the sweet side. Do order the noodles in L size, sometimes S comes in a really tiny portion, not sure why 

Update : 9/4/24
Decided to test out the Rm5 chicken rice. This must be the cheapest I've ever had!! The chicken wings served were delicious...not too dry, but definitely well cooked, tastes deep fried with a thin crisp skin, has an oil soy based gravy to add to your plate of rice, no cucumber so if you need veg...time to addon a plate of tauge, it's just shockingly good value.

The large crowd starts to thin after 1pm so the harassed crew get some relax time and actually are rather nice. BUT if you come at peak time, you'll understand why tempers can flare- orders on top of orders, no tables, even though you get served pretty fast. Unfortunately, the wonderful char Siu has sold out by 1pm, so just order the blood sausage, chicken, wantan mee and tauge ( I normally really dislike that unclean, too earthy taste of blood sausage but was shocked that even eaten cold, it tastes like Bak kwa! )

May update: still the favourite wantan mee with char Siu! But kena parking Saman

"I had the chance to try this Thai restaurant recently and was really impressed with both the flavors and the variety of dishes. Every item we ordered had its own unique kick, and you could tell the ingredients were fresh and cooked with care.
*	Fried Rice Belacan: Fragrant, slightly smoky, and perfectly seasoned. The belacan gave it that bold umami punch without being overpowering, and the wok hei flavor really stood out. Definitely a must-order.
*	Tomyam: Comforting and fiery, with the right balance of sourness and spiciness. The broth was rich, aromatic, and packed with herbs--every spoonful had depth and heat.
*	Green Curry: Creamy, flavorful, and not too sweet. The curry had just the right amount of spice, with tender meat and vegetables soaked in a rich, fragrant sauce that paired perfectly with rice.
*	Chilli Paste Fish Fillet: This dish was intense--in the best way! Spicy, rich, and heavy on the santan (coconut milk), giving it a thick, creamy texture that clung to the fish beautifully. It had a strong kick, so definitely one for spice lovers.

Overall, the food was bold, authentic, and deeply satisfying. If you love strong flavors, a good amount of spice, and dishes cooked with generous amounts of santan, this spot won't disappoint. This is a must-visit restaurant in Shah Alam! If you never try this, I would say you had never been to Shah Alam",FALSE

"Visited Famous Thai and was quite disappointed considering the expensive prices. We had the tomyam seafood, butter prawns, and omelette -- all tasted quite underwhelming.

The tomyam was overly spicy with very little sourness or aroma, missing the signature balance. On top of that, the seafood (especially the squid and prawns) was overcooked and turned out extra chewy, which made it less enjoyable.

The butter prawns and omelette were both oily, not crispy, and lacked flavour. The only things we enjoyed were the watermelon drink and mineral water.

Service was okay -- staff were polite and attentive.

The conveyor belt had very limited choices, with the same dishes going around. I had no choice but to order through the QR code, but the service was very slow from start to finish.

Food taste and presentation were decent, and the portion was just right. But the long wait for food, plus getting salty soy sauce even after asking for sweet, and having to wait again just to get the bill made the whole visit feel frustrating.

Price was fairly affordable, but with the hygiene issues and slow service, I don't think I'd return unless things improve.",FALSE

"This happened 2 weeks ago but only now I have time to review. I went to the Sec 7 outlet to get some food for my family before reaching home. It was also my first time visiting this outlet, and the experience was very disappointing. The restaurant was quite busy, and I was standing at the counter for almost 10 minutes without anyone attending to me. I noticed one lady sitting at a table, and I am quite sure she was the supervisor since her uniform was different from the other staff. She could clearly see the restaurant was busy and short of staff, yet she continued chatting with one guy (I assume her friend or boyfriend, I'm not sure, but honestly I don't care) instead of helping out. Are you here to work or just to chat? The company is paying for your time and effort, not for you to sit idle. Customers were queuing, but she still didn't seem to care.

On top of that, one female staff member (I was later told her name is Safiqah) was attended to customers in a very unfriendly and rude manner. Her attitude was impolite, dismissive, and unprofessional. If Pop Meals continues to keep this kind of Supervisor and staff, I don't think customers will want to come back again. This was my first visit -- and definitely my last. So sorry",FALSE

The nasi goreng was basah, tasted salty, and nowhere near acceptable quality.

The service is unhygienic -- waiter carried drinks by hand instead of using a tray, and even held the glass right at the tip where customers put their lips. This is unacceptable.

Because drinks were not served properly, one slipped and spilled on the floor, making the place sticky and slippery. It was not cleaned up immediately, showing poor attention to cleanliness.

What's most concerning is hygiene. The staff wear gloves but never change them throughout their shift. The same gloves are used for everything--cleaning, serving, and even handling coffee cups. I've seen the gloves touching the coffee directly, which is very unhygienic.

"If you're craving authentic Chinese flavors with a modern twist, Dolly Dim Sum at AEON Mall Shah Alam is a must-visit. We recently dined there and were thoroughly impressed by both the food and the ambiance.

 What We Ordered:
- Prawn Cheong Fun - silky rice rolls wrapped around juicy prawns, served with a light soy dressing that elevated every bite.
- Salted Egg Congee - comforting and creamy, with a rich salted egg flavor that made it a standout.
- Sea Coconut Surprise - a refreshing dessert that perfectly balanced sweetness and texture.
- Salted Prawn Dumpling - crispy on the outside, succulent on the inside, with a satisfying salted touch.
- Salted Fish Fried Rice - fragrant and flavorful, with just the right amount of saltiness from the fish.
- Cantonese Noodles - wok-fried to perfection, with a savory gravy that clings to every strand.
- Beef Kway Teow - tender beef slices and smooth rice noodles in a smoky, well-seasoned stir-fry.
- Szechuan Dumpling - bold and spicy, with a punchy chili oil that left us wanting more.

 Ambiance & Service:

"Came here on a whim to tapau, and I was so surprised how good the food is considering the price is very reasonable compared to its other competitors.

I ordered personal Mandy Chicken Rice (got a quarter chicken portion) for RM 13.90, and it did not disappoint. The portion is generous, the chicken and rice actually tasted well-smoked (as it should be), the salsa is thick and balanced with the hint of spiciness & tomato umami, the soup is hearty and not bland, even the presentation of the meal is so thoughtfully done by the kitchen team, even though it was just for takeaway.

The other thing I ordered was the hummus, and they included a bread with it (total RM 8). It's a decent hummus, with I think like dried rose petal flakes as garnish? Again, love the presentation of everything they served here.

On weekdays 12-2.30pm (if I'm mistaken), you can enjoy their value lunch set. The mandy chicken rice will then be priced at only RM 12.90 with drinks included. As for the rest of the menu, you can browse through the pictures of the menu I've included here.

Note: they don't accept card payments here, only QR and cash are acceptable.

10/10 definitely will come here again, this time it's to try out their grilled dishes and shawarma.",FALSE
"We've been ordering food from here for a while now. We love the chicken shawarma because of the sauce and the chicken that us seasoned well. There are a lot of stores selling shawarma but this is to our taste.

We decided to go for a visit and dine in. The restaurant is quite small but comfortable enough. Staff service was okay but we did have to wait for a bit for the order to be ready. But it was worth it because the mandy chicken was also good. If you're dining in, I recommend you to try the bread. It was crispy on the sides and really soft. Tasted so good when you eat it while it's hot.

"If you're looking for a hearty, home-cooked Malaysian meal that hits the spot, Restoran Dapur Embun in Setia Alam is a solid choice.

We ordered a simple but satisfying spread:
 Steamed white rice,
 A rich and flavorful tom yam soup with prawns,
 Daging masak merah (sweet & spicy beef),
 A plate of stir-fried mixed vegetables,
 And two servings of fluffy telur dadar (omelette).

Each dish had that authentic kampung-style touch. The tom yam was tangy and aromatic, with a comforting level of spice. The daging masak merah was tender and deeply spiced -- a must-try if you enjoy bold flavors. The mixed vegetables were cooked just right, not too oily, with a nice crunch and natural sweetness. As for the telur dadar, it was golden, soft, and complemented the meal well.

The portion sizes were generous, perfect for sharing. The atmosphere was relaxed and casual, making it a great spot for lunch or dinner with family or friends.

 Prices: Reasonable for the portions and taste

"Came at 8.30 pm. to order buffet. To my knowledge I'm supposed to get 90 minutes of dining.

Spaghetti was not avaible which I found out only befire paying. Came to try, but not to repeat.",FALSE

We ordered the Black Truffle Burger and the Australian Beef Burger, both of which were delicious and well-prepared. Burgers can also be upgraded to a set with drinks and fries, making it a complete and satisfying meal.

One thing that stood out is the value for money. Even though the price range is around RM15-20, the quality and portion size make it worth every ringgit. On top of that, the restaurant runs plenty of offers and promotions, so you really get your money's worth here.

The ambiance is cozy and welcoming, making it a nice spot to hang out with friends or family. Parking is also relatively easy, which adds to the convenience.

Then my food came wrong! Tak apa lah sbb saya tak cerewet. Part yg paling tak best is when I yg ajak kawan2 utk makan di sini tetapi layanan very poor.

"Dine in on 21/08/2025.
1. HYGIENE ISSUES 
Found baby cockroach in teh tarik.

Told manager at 1:40pm,not even a ""sorry.""

Told him to check the drink machine where the teh tarik are coming from.

Paid in FULL at 1:49pm at cashier,still not even a single sorry. So regret to even dine here.

2. Different charges
I paid before i sat down RM92.35 at 12:39pm

After 10mins,the manager came and said they accidentally charged me less so they void the payment and gave the new price which is RM99.80.

The rice was too lembik, and there was no budu, which is a must for nasi kerabu.

Cleanliness: The tables, floor, and surroundings were clean. No rubbish or food waste around.

Food: A bit of a letdown. My mom asked for ikan bakar but we got ikan stim instead. Taste-wise it was just okay. My mom rated it 2 stars, I'd give it 3. Portions were medium, not too big or too small, and for 5 people it was decent enough.

"Kedai ok,parking luas,view cantik,staffs pun ok senyum kat kami, waktu tunggu tak lama dapat air dan makanan. Meja no 6 datang 16.8.2025/ 6pm..order set B tambah lauk sotong goreng tepung,dan air tembikai 1 jug.total RM170.00

Kuantiti ok cukup utk 7 org dewasa makan,tak habis kami minta tapau untuk sambung mkn di homestay.
Ikan siakap 3 rasa ikan fresh tapi agak manis sos 3 rasanya,tawar sedikit.
Tomyam campur kuahnya pun manis kurang mantap.
Sotong goreng tepung kurang menjadi
Udang masak butter, udang tak fresh kulit dah hitam hitam.
Telur dadar ok
Sayur pun ok
Air tembikai sgttttttttt manis hingga terpaksa tambah air masak.terlebih gula agaknya utk masakan dan air jus hari ini semanis senyuman seorang staff lelaki yg antar makanan dan tapaukan mknan kami yg tak habis tu .
Ada kucing sy bagi makan snek khas kucing,staff tak marah atau halau kucing tu..terbaik...kucing pun baik tak panjat meja .duduk bawah meja je.

"From the moment we stepped in, we were greeted with warm smiles that instantly made us feel welcome. The staff entertained our family with genuine friendliness, helped us choose the best dishes, and even advised us on the right weight of seafood so to cater our budget. They suggested cooking styles that truly brought out the freshness of the ingredients. Most importantly, they never once made us feel looked down upon -- we felt respected and valued customers from start to finish.

The food took around 45 minutes to prepare, but it was worth every second. The presentation was beautiful, setting the stage for the star of the night -- the lobster. Without a doubt, it was the best lobster I've ever had. The creamy cheese sauce was rich and flavorful, perfectly complementing the fresh, juicy lobster meat -- clearly not something that had been frozen for ages. The tools provided made it easy to crack open the shell and enjoy every bite.

Next came the ikan bakar pari. The sambal was simply outstanding -- I honestly wished there was more of it! The asam sauce was a nice, tangy touch, and the garnish of fresh lemon (not limau kasturi!) added the perfect finishing note. Every other dish we ordered was equally tasty -- nothing bland, nothing overpowered.
Now comes the pricing, its worth the money u pay.

Parking is also plentiful, so no stress before or after the meal. The view of sunset dengan laut  dengan angin sepoi2 mmg tempat ni padu.. Overall, we will definitely come again. Big thanks to the chef for the amazing food, and special appreciation to the lovely lady who took such good care of us. This is absolutely a must-visit spot for seafood lovers!

"We had quite a disappointing experience at Daddy's Cafe, Pangkor.

Service: Terribly slow. We could only place our order after waiting around 1 hour, even after calling 2-3 staff multiple times. When the food finally came, it was served one by one, some of us had already finished eating while others hadnt even received their food yet. The only reason we stayed was because we had already booked a birthday decoration at the cafe.

Halal assurance: Not convincing for muslim customers. They say they separate utensils for muslim and non muslim (alcohol) use, but theres no visible proof unless you personally ask.

Food quality:
- Nasi goreng ayam tasted off, too sweet yet bland, as if sugar was used instead of salt. The fried egg served with it was spoiled, which was very unpleasant.
- Watermelon juice was only said to be unavailable when we had nearly finished our meal.
- Hot tea tasted like tap water.
- Western food is just edible, nothing special.

Price: Overpriced, probably due to the location, but there are definitely better options for tourists around the island.

Communication: Some staff couldnt even speak malay. While we can converse in eng, this is still Malaysia, a cafe here should be able to serve both locals and foreigners properly.

the view and location may be nice for photos or events, but the service, food quality, and halal assurance fall far below expectations.",FALSE

"Saya datang sebagai salah satu dari hanya dua meja pelanggan yang sudah ada lebih awal. Kami sudah buat pesanan terlebih dahulu, tapi ternyata pelanggan yang datang kemudian justru mendapatkan makanan mereka lebih dulu.

Kami terpaksa menunggu selama 40-45 minit sebelum makanan sampai ke meja kami. Sepanjang waktu menunggu, tiada penjelasan diberikan pelayan hanya membisu tanpa sebarang komunikasi. Ini sangat tidak profesional dan menunjukkan layanan yang kurang prihatin terhadap pelanggan.

Jika ada sebab kenapa makanan lambat contohnya masalah dapur, kekeliruan dalam sistem, atau pesanan tertentu yang mengambil masa lebih lama tolong maklumkan kepada pelanggan. Kami faham jika ada masalah, tapi bukan dengan diam membisu dan membiarkan pelanggan merasa diabaikan.

Masa datang hanya 3 biji kereta ya. Nak balik ada 5-6 biji kereta dan waktu tu baru nak siap makanan.

Had much better friend rice outside warung. Won't recommend anyone to dine here until they fix the quality and chef problem.

I feedback to the restaurant supervisor on duty when getting my bill. All he could say is he'll feedback to the chef. Not even an apology. I guess they have been receiving such complaints from many diners until their immune to it.

"We decide to dine in Makan Kitchen during our stay at Hilton DoubleTree Damai Laut, and it was an absolute delight!

Since it was the Ramadan season, the buffet was Malay cuisine-focused, offering a fantastic selection of authentic traditional dishes that truly captured the spirit of the festive month. The variety was impressive, with flavorful rendang,  tender satay, and rich, hearty curries that were cooked to perfection. The selection of ulam (Malay-style salads) and sambals added a wonderful burst of flavor to every bite.

To end the meal, the dessert spread was a treat, featuring traditional Malay kuih, sweet cendol, and a variety of refreshing drinks like air siram bandung and fresh coconut water.

The service was top-notch. The staff was incredibly attentive, always checking in to ensure we were comfortable and well taken care of. They even offered great recommendations on what to try, which made the dining experience even better.

The ambiance was cozy yet elegant, with a relaxing view of the resort surroundings. The warm, festive decorations and the sense of togetherness made the experience even more special.

The dedication to authentic Malay flavors and traditional festive dishes made this a truly memorable dining experience. We'll definitely be back!",FALSE

"I had a very disappointing experience at Makan Kitchen. When I arrived, the staff told me the tables were full and assigned me to a terrible spot. My chair was placed in the walkway and directly behind a cooler fan, making it extremely uncomfortable. I asked the staff to move me to a better table, but they said they were just following instructions from the reception and couldn't make any changes. On top of that, the fruit was not fresh, and the food didn't taste good. The lack of flexibility, poor service, and subpar food quality made this an unpleasant dining experience.",FALSE

"Makan Kitchen at the Hilton Doubletree Lumut, expecting the reputed excellent service from a 5-Star Hotel. Regrettably, my experience was far from satisfactory.

For a 5-Star Hotel? Think twice. Both the Hotel and Makan Kitchen were overpriced. The cramped dining areas become a nightmare when it rains, forcing everyone inside and making it incredibly uncomfortable. The poor ventilation causes the unpleasant smell of food to cling to your clothes. I had to navigate through a crowd just to reach my seat and avoid dropping my food on the floor.
Flies were everywhere! They were landing over the food, and I couldn't even think about eating it.

The fish was tough and overcooked, the sausage was hard, and the herb-infused egg was cooked with the shell still on. Items that ran out were not replenished, including the cereal for kids, which was very limited and never restocked. I've stayed in 3-star hotels that were far better!
For the record, the buffet dinner costs RM80-RM90 on weekdays and RM128 on weekends. However, even if you pay the RM128, you may not get to enjoy the full experience, as they do not replenish items that run out. The breakfast options were limited, and, as I mentioned, they didn't replenish items even like the fresh milk and cereal for kids. It was quite disappointing.

Furthermore, the prices were exorbitant given the quality of service received. I am willing to pay a premium for a premium experience, but this fell drastically short of expectations. Think carefully before reserving a seat there. Make sure to ask them to explain the procedures if you want ala carte, or you might end up being charged the full buffet price without realizing it.

In summary, Makan Kitchen did not meet the fundamental standards of a reputable restaurant, let alone those of a 5-star venue. The service was incredibly disappointing, with unprofessional handling and rude, impolite responses to our concerns. I won't be coming back and would strongly advise others to think twice before choosing this place.

The food was great. Wife and I both had those stone bowl rice meals. Hers was prawn, mine was chicken teriyaki. Portion was generous, and both were flavourful. My chicken was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.

I understand it was close to closing time, but that's no excuse to treat paying customers this way. If you don't want to serve people late, then close earlier. At the very least, serve hot food -- that's basic.

What made it worse, I had actually placed an order earlier through the Popmeal app. I was a little late because of traffic, and your staff cancelled the order and claimed it was ""user cancelled.""

Chicken chop - ayam rangup kat luar juicy di dalam dan cukup rasa, side dish  grill vegie mmg kesukaan saya dengan fries serta sos chicken chop yg sgt sedap ada potongan cendawan dlm nye..

Mac & cheese - portion yang mengenyangkan, terasa lemak cheese nya yg tak memuakkan pada saya..
4.5/5

Spagheti aglio olio ayam - tumisan bwg putih, ayam & capsicum serta texture pasta itu sendiri yg tidak kering membangkitkan selera. Dish yg simple tapi memuaskan hati
4.5/5

Beef bacon burger - patty burger seberat 100gm yg diadun sendiri mempunyai rasa yg moist & sedap dilengkapi pula dgn bacon & cheese serta sos black pepper ... Side dish nye adalah fries..
4/5

Sizzling yee mee chicken chop - kuah Sizzling yg cukup kepekatannya, rasa balance masin, manis & hangat black peppernya. Selain itu sayur yg digunakan adalah sawi pak choy, sekarang ni jarang jumpa Sizzling yg guna sawi kebanyakan nye guna salad.. Thumbs up sebab mengekalkan sayur sawi tu

"My honest review

Last week I tertinggal my Laptop after lunch dgn my friend dekat cafe @eighty7ounces tapi I baru sedar I tertinggal after 2 days

I cuba naseb call this cafe, Alhamdulillah dengan jujurnya owner cakap memang dia ada simpankan & dia xtahu macam mana nak contact I

Im so touch & bangga dengan peniaga macam ni. Dia boleh je pura2 tak tahu and I tak boleh salahkan dia sebab yg cuai tu I

Thanks owner & I sendiri nak rate kedai ni
10

1) Makanan sedap, even nuget dia pun sedap(my friend cakap sbb lembut) bukti dia tengok kat gambar ni licin. I tak try coffee dia tp ice chocolate dia sedap.

2) Service tiptop walaupun orang ramai

3) Cafe bersih & sesuai utk lepak lama dan boleh jadi port ootd

4) Jujur. Seriusss. I jarang bagi review kedai. Tapi ni review sebab I rasa this cafe deserve utk dapat good review

Moga rezeki kedai ni melimpah ruah & lebih ramai customer datang kedai ni.

"I've tried it before with my colleagues few months back. Wanted to do a review straight away but could not find them in google.

Here's our review :
The fried chicken was extremely tough, almost like it had been reheated multiple times. It also tasted like old chicken. Dry and not juicy at all. The mashed potato didn't taste right either, something was definitely off. On top of that, the order took a long time to arrive even though the place wasn't crowded.

This was our first time trying a local brand, but it was really disappointing. I myself couldn't even finish my food because of how bland + hard/ tough the chicken was. Definitely, wasn't worth the price.

The place itself was alright, ambience was nice for a small fast-food restaurant. They even have these cute chicken squishy at the front table.

I might come again in the future to see if there's any improvement. If not, I'll update this review accordingly. Please do something about it. If there's any improvement and the owner see this comment, do reply my comment here ill be open to try again and amend my reviews if it has indeed improve thank you.",FALSE

"Restoran Cahaya Malam Sungai Udang is a well-loved Thai seafood tomyam restaurant that attracts both locals and visitors with its authentic flavors and lively atmosphere. The highlight of this restaurant is, of course, the tomyam--rich, aromatic, and filled with generous portions of seafood such as prawns, squid, and fish. Customers often mention how the broth strikes the perfect balance between spicy, sour, and savory, making it an unforgettable dish that keeps people coming back. Beyond tomyam, the restaurant also serves a wide variety of Thai seafood specialties, including grilled fish, butter prawns, and crab dishes, all prepared with fresh ingredients and flavorful seasonings. The menu caters to both spice lovers and those who prefer milder options, ensuring that everyone finds something to enjoy. The ambience at Cahaya Malam is relaxed and cheerful, with an open-air concept that makes it comfortable for family dinners, gatherings with friends, or casual late-night suppers. Despite the often busy crowd, service is usually quick and attentive, with staff doing their best to accommodate customer needs. Prices are fair for the portion sizes and quality offered, making it a great value-for-money option.

Such a cool tiny hole-in-the-wall bar. I will say it was a little tricky to find. But once you spotted it hidden in the corner it was a neat little place near the marina. Felt somewhat like a speakeasy bar hidden near the ocean. We came in Tuesday night for a quick drink. Had the whole bar to ourselves. Ended up staying longer than we anticipated. We had a great and long-time chitchatting and laughing with one of the workers there named Kyle. Loved that they had a few shelves where they sold cigarettes.

"After our epic 2+ hours bicycle ride on the nearby Spanish Moss Trail, we were famished! This place was highly rated and we were only 5 minutes away.

Hubby had fish n chips. I couldn't take a picture since he gobbled it down so quickly. Between bites, I heard only praise at how awesome his meal was. Generously 3 pieces of fish, served piping hot.

I had their house burger: Two fried eggs, fresh tomato, pickles, onions and cheese piled high on a fresh bun and a fat patty cooked perfectly!

I always order my fries extra well done and I have never complained if I get them and they are burnt. More often than not, my request is forgotten or ignored, and I end up with regular-cooked spuds, which is what I thought happened during our visit. However.... The lovely and amazing server named Amber, brought us a second order of piping hot extra crispy fries without being asked. :) She apologize that our first order hadn't been quite cooked enough, dropped off the order of fries with a big smile. Awesome!

Lots of parking, totally wheelchair, accessible, space outside for dogs to hang out.

Good layout, typical bar/eating areas. Looks like there may have been a pool table in there at one point (there's a nice big space for one, but there are tables and chairs instead?).

Overall cleanliness, pretty good. I would recommend that the framed pictures at the tables be properly cleaned as there was food splatter on them.

Another suggestion: We noticed that the young lady/hostess, who originally seated us, did not give off very friendly/happy vibes. Maybe just an off day for her, but as far as first impression goes, it could've been better.

Small discomfort was how cold it was inside... maybe the AC was turned on full blast?  Maybe we were just super hot from being outdoors exercising? Brrr...

And finally, if we go back, we would not choose a booth seat again. Every time the diners behind us moved, my entire bench would move with them. Annoying.

Two thumbs up.",FALSE
"At one time, you could find an exceptional burger here. Today's experience proved ""somethings do change."" We waited for almost 45 minutes for 2 Brickyard burgers & fries. We finally asked to pay for our drinks so we could just leave. We asked for the manager and of course, miraculously our food was being plated so we stayed. The food came out cold ...cheese didn't melt on either burger, my husband's bun was burnt and was so hard it was not editable and the fries were mushy & cold. Our meal was comped but we were asked to please not leave a bad review.  Sorry not sorry!! We do NOT recommend wasting time here.",FALSE

Upon entering, we told the hostess that we would sit outside. we waited over 30 minutes. The server never came to us and never even brought out water. There were other ppl outside that were being attended to. Felt like we were ignored. To include, wasnt a busy night. We ended up leaving due to the extreme lack of service. My fiance was embarrassed. Would not recommend.",FALSE

"Great food and atmosphere. This place was fun and very unique. This is a amazing hidden gem in a beautiful city. I met one of the owners while looking around the bar. He was very polite, informative, thankful, and fantastic to talk to. I also spoke with one of the female bartenders who was fun to talk to and very informative about the area. I already had dinner but do to the unique menu I chose to order two of their apitizers to take back to my hotel. The appetizers did not disappoint. I will will definitely be back to try their full menu with family/friends!

The only reason I rated the food 4/5 is due to not having any of their main dishes to accurately vouch for. When I return and have their full menu with friends/family I will update this post!",FALSE
"During our Beaufort stay, my friend and I were looking for a happy hour destination and Old Bull Tavern was just down the street from our accommodations.

"Mike the bartender was a great ambassador to the Old Bull.
He started us off with amazing cocktails and then followed it up with the most amazing starter..... the stuffed figs!!!!!

"Can hold up to any gastropub anywhere. Seriously.. ANYWHERE.

Creative and well-executed dishes.  Unique ingredients and flavor combination.  My garnishment veggies were superb. Carrots were subtly sweet.   Steak was done as requested (though teres major should be a tad above rare. That was my fault, as they nailed it with a perfect sear and beautiful presentation.   Pasta was homemade and perfectly al dente. Creamy sauce was brightened with fresh lemon.   Super hospitality.   I've heard it described as 'Charleston at half the price.'  Probably accurate.",FALSE

We headed to the 3 open seats at the bar and as we were sitting, a women yelled from behind us ""oh isn't this where you want US to sit?"" And the bartender asked us to get up because he saved the seats. He followed us to the front and said he would but our name in. Then 3 more parties came through and were sat and the place was filling up. I went and asked if he put our name in and he said ""I will if you'd like me to"".

"Not going to be too dramatic and give a one star, but man the food was all mediocre to bad, the shoulder char tasted like lighter fluid and rust. The pasta lacked soul and felt watered down.

The atmosphere was nice and the service was good but the food was ""fine, nothing special"" to bad. I ordered a steak cooked medium rare. It came out well done. Sent it back and it came back medium well. At that point I gave up. For the prices they are charging, the cooks really should know how to cook a steak. Probably won't go back.",FALSE

"My wife and I came here while on vacation. Food was good, server did well. A unique spot close to the water.",FALSE
So the menu is really well designed and plenty of choice. I had the perilou appetizer and the flavor was amazing. As a entre I had the blackened Dorado and while the floor was tasty it lacked depth. Maybe a tad bit of salt. One complaint was we love bread and it is the south so some type of carb with our dinner would have been lovely. For dessert we had the pot of cream and while simple it was light and perfect. I do recommend this place for special occasions but prices of everything has gone thru the roof. With my 22% tip (she deserved it) it was a pricey dinner. I guess I am just getting old.,FALSE

I found the mai to be undercooked in a bit.Gelatinous in the middle, while my bluecrab infused crab cake shows very little. If any signs are coming blue crab, actually, in it, the borderline false advertising on that one

I look forward to the day, when I can once again read, ""all are welcome"" or just drop the statements all together. May God continue to bless this establishment and the customers that are fortunate enough to enjoy the experience of enjoying having a meal with family or friends here .",FALSE

Previous review:
We ate here on a trip to Beaufort this weekend. My fiance and I enjoyed it! We got the fried shrimp, cornbread, she crab soup, grouper special, shrimp and scallops, and shared a tiramisu and it was all delicious. The hostess and waitress were very nice, and the food was very good. The only thing that I didn't enjoy was what seemed like the lack of A/C. We were seated in the front dining area, and it was hot there. I was in a summery dress and not very comfortable. Otherwise, we will most likely come back if we are in the area again!",FALSE

"My friends and I decided to check out The Fillin station yesterday after avoiding it for so many years (we are all born and raised in Beaufort)....prior experiences were not too impressive with service, atmosphere or ""acceptance""....our experience yesterday was the complete opposite! We walked in and immediately felt welcomed as we were greeted with actual SMILES!! A little goes a long way, folks, and a smile instead of a look of annoyance can make a HUGE difference! Service was impeccable -- by the time we were to the last sips of a beer, someone was swingin' by our table to check on us and offer another! Although we didn't eat much, the food we did have (wings & fries) were great! The most satisfying part was having one of the owners, Michelle, came by our table after noticing we had been there for a while (we stayed for 5hrs ), she warmly greeted us, introduced herself and kindly welcomed us back anytime with the emphasis of creating a space for ALL locals! We will definitely be back and can now comfortably recommend The Fillin Station! Thank you!",FALSE
What a great way to spend our Saturday afternoon! The place was extremely busy but the food was absolutely worth the wait!

Great shrimp. Terrible attitude. This born and raised southern gal loves fresh shrimp on the water, and I'm so happy to be back in town for good, but man, the chick behind the bar is 0/3.

My husband had the Philly cheese sandwich with homemade potato chips. He said it was okay. The chips were overdone. The atmosphere was loud and noisy. We waited for a hostess to seat us 10 minutes. To give proper perspective, it was a Saturday at around 12:30.",FALSE

This morning the restaurant was very busy, and I wish I got the young lady's name, but she handled the front well. Because she took call in orders, and walk in orders. All while, one of the computers not working. Plus the register didn't have any receipt tape. But kudos to her because she stayed professional despite what all was going on.

The drinks, appetizers, main courses, and desserts were all very good. Panini's was the icing in the cake for a very special occasion. THANK YOU PANINI'S!!",FALSE
Got the almond crusted calamari as an appetizer and it was just okay. The calamari itself was tender but there was no flavor to be found. Got a shrimp panini with pasta salad as the entree.

The sweet tea was the best tasting thing at this restaurant. Would not suggest going here even for your dog.,FALSE
"We had a present experience at paintings tonight. We both ordered Mediterranean salads. The small version, but I also added a side of meatballs, the meatballs were very tasty and flavored, very well. They were firm, but not tight. The sauce that was put on them were very good. The salad I had in my dressing put on the side so as not to saturate the salad, the salad was very good and it was a large portion for a small salad. The 2 items together did really well. But at the beginning of the meal, we asked for some bread and some Olive oil and our writer was very accommodating and brought the bread and Olive oil out. However, we didn't get a plate or a bread plate or anything to kind of put our bread down on, so there was that outside of that the ambiance of the place was kind of nice a little hollow sounding, it would have been nice to have a lot of music.

We had a party of 8, service was honestly lacking and forced a 20% tip at the end.

I would love to hit one of their special wine dinners and see what a special occasion is like.

Tonight I was heading home and saw the 'available sign"" illuminated so immediately pulled in.  It is the first time since the reopening and I was excited.  I called my elderly mother, who is not a 'foodie' or otherwise but I have taken to Blacks Sheep multiple times and she has expanded her culinary horizon, and she immediately abandoned her dinner cooking and came to me me at Black Sheep.  When Krista took our order, I just told her to have Matt prepare whatever he wanted for us from the menu selection for the evening.  As always, everything was perfect.  My mother is a basic ""meat and potatoes"" generation, but not when it come to Matt and Black Sheep, her palate has been expanded!

"What a great breakfast! The biscuits and gravy were great. I've been told to try the corned beef and hash, and I will next time, for sure! They accommodated a Gluten allergy very well.  Egg whites are available, and they have gluten free bread/toast, which was good! The coffee is super good. The service was great. The real winner about this place is the patriotism!  The walls are full of law enforcement, fire service, and military type stuff.  It's a great site to see and a lot of American flags and patriotism. The ambiance is excellent. Thank you for being there for us!",FALSE
This place has great value for the quality and quantity of food. The servers were very nice and offered refills of coffee non stop. Will be back!,FALSE
"Indoor atmosphere left much to be desired. Patio was nice enough until the cooks started bringing out the garbage and taking their smoke breaks upwind of us.
Service was fine.
Food was mediocre at best: Sweet and Savory Platter, Parfait and Bagel
The Arnold Palmer was my favorite part of the meal, which says a lot.
French toast undercooked and bland
Bacon soft
Eggs barely scrambled
Grits grainy, not at all smooth or creamy",FALSE

"Charming spot but the service  and especially the food has taken a serious nosedive since it changed ownership. It used to be one of my favorite spots in Beaufort but the past couple of visits haven't just been disappointing, the food was cold and straight up gross. Such a shame.

Update: The owner is upset by my review and accusing me of falsehoods. Don't even know what he is talking about. I'm fully aware the new ownership started 4 years ago. I've been three times during those four years and each time has been worse than the last. So sorry if you can't handle some truth in your life. Grow a thicker skin or improve the food.",FALSE

"Good day to anyone reading this and hopefully this serves as a warning to NEVER step foot into this establishment moving forward... If it was possible to give 0 stars, we would. Mind you, we we are super easy going people and don't complain about dinning experiences ever! We are from the Beaufort area originally and have family here dating back 50 years. Never in of our dinning experiences have we experienced what we did at Blackstone Grill today.

We stayed at the Beaufort Inn for the night and they provided us with (4) vouchers for my husband, myself and our (2) children in the amount of up to $10 per person for use at Blackstone. Being that we have our puppy with us, we decided to go get breakfast this morning. My husband made sure to ask if that was okay to do with the vouchers and they said that was fine, and that he just needed to pay the difference beyond the voucher $ amount. The total came up to be $59 and change, or $19 and change beyond the $40 in vouchers. My husband was given the option to tip on the $19, but he tipped $15.00 (25%) on a TO GO ORDER.

They did not visually verify the contents of the to go order prior to leaving. My husband walked back down the street to bring back food to our room and after our kids had started eating their food out of their to go boxes, we realized we were missing (2) fried eggs, an English muffin, and a side of bacon. He immediately walked back and attempted to politely explain what was going on to the front desk staff. He was questioned and told that everything was in the bag until he insisted that was not the case. The girl at the front that originally took the order then went and spoke and the Manager and came back and insisted that he needed to go back to bring all of the contents to them from the order to verify! Absolutely insane in itself , but he came back to our room and grabbed all of our half eaten food from our hungry kids hands, loaded it back into the bag, and went back to Blackstone.

They then took the bag back and returned a few minutes later proclaiming rudely, ""My manager said it's all good now"" without VERIFYING YET AGAIN.  Well upon returning we realized while they did add a box containing the English Muffin and bacon, the (2) eggs were STILL missing! Again, this was absolutely the WORST dining experience that we have had in over 40 years in the Lowcountry! 

Update to owners response: My review was in regards to the to go order that was missing several items purchased and how we were treated when bringing this to your establishments attention. We never asked to eat with our dog there, we specifically asked for only ""to go"" ordering. We were not accommodated in any way, we were interrogated and told we were liars over some eggs, bacon and an English muffin we paid for and tipped on as if we had dined in. The order was not verified before given to the customer and the interrogation left us wanting to warn others.",FALSE
"If you're a fan of good food and patriotism, Blackstone's is for you. As a fellow business owner in town, we support our local businesses. Breakfast is great. The Rueben for lunch is a crowd favorite.

"What a nice southern sandwich shop with a relaxed vibe. They offer chicken salad and shrimp salad sandwiches or plates, Po Boys (both shrimp and Friend Flounder versions), salads and several other dishes. I highly recommend their shrimp salad plate as well as their pork dumpling appetizer served with bacon jam. They have both indoor seating as well as outdoor patio seating overlooking the water and marina. Highly recommended!",FALSE
"Good food, great service. Loved sitting outside overlooking the water.",FALSE
"My dining experience at Plum in Beaufort was disappointing, with the food falling below expectations and a billing issue that left a negative impression.
The hamburger was a standout, well-prepared and flavorful, making it a bright spot in the meal. However the shrimp po' boy, which I was eager to try, was a major letdown. The bread was a stark white instead of the golden, crispy texture you'd expect from a well-made po' boy, and it lacked any notable flavor, making the dish feel flat. The shrimp and grits were equally unimpressive, missing the rich, soulful taste that defines this Southern staple. Overall, the food quality didn't live up to the charm of Beaufort's dining scene.
Additionally, we were charged an automatic tip without clear notification, leading us to tip again unknowingly. This lack of transparency was frustrating and felt deceptive.
Plum has potential given its location, but the kitchen needs to focus on improving dish execution--starting with properly baked, flavorful bread--and the staff should be upfront about billing practices. I hope they address these issues to elevate the experience for future guests.",FALSE

"I was exceptionally surprised at how good the food was. Im a true Southern cook and I have to say some of these dishes could give me a run for my money. Everything was well seasoned and cooked perfectly! The ribs, chicken and pork was slow cooked and felled off the bone as we ate. The sides were amazing!! The mac n cheese was delicious but those collard greens took the whole cake! Well seasoned and bursting with flavor! They actually used real smoked meat in their greens! Tasted so good I wanted to go back for more but I was on my way back to Florida!! Very friendly staff with that sweet, charming, Southern Hospitality!! I felt so at home!! Of you're ever in the area and want good BBQ I recommend Q on the Bay.",FALSE

"I don't typically leave less than 5 Star reviews but I was very disappointed by the food here. Service was great. We were sat quickly, our server was busy so the hostess came and took our drink order immediately and soon after our server came over and apologized for the delay. We were very happy with the service but the food was just not good. The tacos weren't much a tacos and all and are dry pulled pork on a crunchy dried up tortilla. We were also very disappointed by the ribs. Maybe the saucy ribs were better but the ones we got were flavorless. The Mac and cheese was also nothing to write home about. The wings were very crispy and tasty though as well as the French fries. We probably will not be back, flavor was not worth the price.",FALSE

"Stopped in to get an order to go. Hostess directed us to the bar to orderand highly recommended the the mahi tacos. We ordered at the bar and ordered a beer while we waited.   An hour later, we were still waiting.  The bartender told us the kitchen was busy with the dining room customers.  I walked into the dining room and there was one table of twelve in the entire dining room.  We finally got our food, walked two minutes to our boat.  The fish on the tacos was way over cooked with little flavor and the cabbage slaw was almost nonexistent.  The fresh cut fries may have been fresh cut, but they were not fresh fried They were limp and greasy. Overall, a very disappointing meal.",FALSE
Okay so this food was the best I've had in beaufort. But my only complaint is that I paid $15 for pad thai... and it looked like they thinly sliced four peices off of a chicken breast. I just think for the price they need to add more meat... especially the wonton. It said it came with Sriracha and mine didn't. They were also mostly fried wonton wrapper. Just put more meat and easily this restaurant would be the best in beaufort. The flavor is there! Crab rangoons were amazing just not that crispy on the bottom.,FALSE

"Ordered chicken pad Thai and spring rolls. Wasn't a fan of either. The spring roll shells were crispy but everything on the inside was mush. I asked if the pad Thai was spicy they said no spice at all. I requested medium spicy the guy said ok. Waited 20 minutes, no problem, it was expected. The food came out. Oh ... He was correct, no spices at all are used. Couldn't even taste a hint of tamarind or anything. Very disappointed. But I think the worst part is all the noodles were so dry they were just a big clump stuck all together. It was not a great experience for me.",FALSE

So, I skeptical about going back , when some friends said they wanted to try it because they heard good things about the food. We ordered a great deal of food. I ordered Ramen , how can you go wrong with Ramen ? It was bad ...very bad ! The spring rolls tasted like they were freezer burnt. The chicken didn't taste fresh. The quality of the food was poor.

Went here for my birthday and had the most amazing experience. The atmosphere is calm and comfortable. The waiter was upbeat and joyful. We did family style and ordered 4 different dishes and shared.

"We ordered takeout and when I arrived at the restaurant to pick up the order I was met with a grumpy employee. She seemed put out when I asked for plastic cutlery and grudgingly went into the kitchen for a fork & spoon. No napkins were provided or offered.
The food was decent but not even close to the medium spice level I requested  - it was mild at best.
The Basil Rolls were supposed to come with a dipping sauce per the online menu but none was included. They were dry and stale, we threw them away.

"Walked into restaurant to see a dog (NOT a service dog) bark at us coming in, then watched a man take a drinking glass and sit it on the floor for the dog.

Finding a place for dinner for 6 on a busy weekend in Beaufort has its challenges. Many restaurants are not open for dinner. We made reservations at a high top as that was all available.

I was in Beaufort for work and decided to grab a bite to eat on my way out of town. I was throughly impressed with the portion of my food and friendliness of the staff.

The food was exceptional--we tried every stone crab item on the menu, the grouper, sushi, and one of each dessert, and everything was fresh and delicious. The drinks were equally impressive, with excellent cocktails and a thoughtful selection of wines and sparkling wines.
One thing we really appreciated is that Locals Raw Bar supports the local fishing community. When we visit Beaufort, we look for restaurants that offer local seafood, and this spot delivered--the stone crab was locally sourced, which is why we ordered every dish featuring it. It's great to see a restaurant highlighting local catches on the menu.
Service was top-notch. Our waitress was knowledgeable about both the menu and drink list, answered all of our questions thoroughly, and made the evening even more enjoyable. The restaurant was also very accommodating of our 4-year-old, which made dining as a family stress-free.

We got so lucky and stumbled in here after we had just gotten into town to start our vacation. I ordered the cabbage pancake and my taste buds could not understand what happened. Truly one of the best things I've ever eaten. And I don't exaggerate when it comes to food. The young couple running this joint are clearly very talented and passionate about what they are building and my family and I were blessed to try their cuisine. Enjoyed everything we tasted. Worth every penny and any small wait we had while the chef made sure our food was exquisite. It truly was.,FALSE
"Locals Raw Bar is a hidden gem in Beaufort that completely blew us away. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was warm, laid-back, and welcoming--exactly what you'd hope for in a Lowcountry spot. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, making us feel like longtime regulars even though it was our first visit.

Now, the food... wow. Every bite was fresh, flavorful, and clearly prepared with care. The oysters were some of the best we've ever had--briny, cold, and perfectly shucked. This is my go-to place for fresh locally caught seafood served in creative and delicious ways.  Even the cocktails were top-notch--creative, balanced, and delicious.

It's rare to find a place that nails the vibe, the food, and the service, but Locals Raw Bar absolutely delivers on all fronts. Whether you're a seafood lover or just someone who appreciates a great meal in a great atmosphere, this place is a must-visit. Can't wait to go back!",FALSE
"Southern hospitality? Not so much. First to confirm the stars: great atmosphere and delicious food but... Walking in I/we didn't feel welcomed. I would even say the three staff members we saw and interacted with to start lacked any enthusiasm. Our server Jessie was having a ""wrong side of the bed"" day and it showed while taking our order. When our order was delivered by another staff member, we mentioned the quantity/mix of one item was incorrect. She said she would take care of it. Jessie then appeared at our table and questioned us on what we had ordered. Really?! Having to ask for more coffee just added to a bad experience. Not to say it was 100% bad. She did have a few standard ""how is everything "" and ""would you like anything else"". Yes we will be back. Yes we would recommend the restaurant but I would go so far as requesting a different server.",FALSE
"My girlfriends and I had the best evening at Lowcountry Produce as they launched their brand-new dinner menu. This restaurant has always been a Beaufort favorite for breakfast, brunch, and lunch, but never for dinner -- until now! And I have to say, they've made the transition beautifully.

The food was elegant, savory, and presented with such care. From the lamb lollipops to the crisp salads and cocktails, every dish was flavorful and memorable. It's clear they've put thought into creating a dinner experience that feels both refined and welcoming.

The setting, with its signature Lowcountry charm, made it the perfect spot for a girls' night out. We were impressed from start to finish and are so excited to see Lowcountry Produce expand into evening dining.

Highly recommend making it a new go-to for dinner in Beaufort!",FALSE

Got some really good brunch for a low price. The items in the market are also cool.The items in the market are also cool.,FALSE
"Gorgeous spot inside, food was ""WOW!"" good. Definitely recommend. We did have to wait to be seated as well as a little during the meal but the inside is so pretty it wasn't too big of a deal and we weren't in a rush. Smoked salmon toast was the winner!",FALSE
"We got to preview the new dinner menu at Low Country Produce and were seriously blown away. From the drinks to the dessert, everything was incredible. The cocktails were delicious, and I'm still thinking about the Caesar salad and tartare--honestly the best I've ever had.

The food not only tasted amazing but looked beautiful too. The whole vibe was so relaxed and welcoming, just like it always is there. It was one of those meals where every course makes you more excited for the next.

We're already talking about when we can go back. This is definitely going to become one of our regular dinner spots!",FALSE
"Lowcountry market is such a gem! The food is fresh, flavorful, and tastes just like I imagine southern comfort food from a grandmother tastes like. (I'm from New England.) I got the eggs benedict and it was absolutely delicious, definitely one of the best I've ever had. The decor is so cute and makes the whole place feel warm and welcoming. The staff is super friendly too, which just adds to the experience. Definitely a must-visit spot in Beaufort!",FALSE
"I have been twice, but never again. Tourists only! A server with a nose ring is an automatic turn-off. No thanks.",FALSE
"We love this place not only for the excellent food choices but the building is one of the coolest restaurants around. The food keeps us coming back, every choice we've made has been a unique flavor profile and always surpasses our hungry eyes as we can rarely finish our plate because portions are big.",FALSE
"Very poor service turned a really good moment with me and my wife into a horrible moment. I tried to double charge me for a product. I said it was not their fault. Poor attitudes from you, the person who checked me out to the manager will never go there again",FALSE
"Got the soup of the day, which was a tomato basil with half a chicken salad sandwich and the lobeca salad. The soup was chunky but also smooth with flecks of basil throughout. The soup was rich and zingy, full bodied with a deep tomato flavor which the basil cut through perfectly. The chicken salad sandwich was good, just your every day chicken salad between perfectly toasty and buttery bread. The lobeca salad was by far the star of the meal with multiple greens, rich creamy feta cheese, zingy pickled green beans, and a cranberry chutney paired perfectly with a lemon vinaigrette. This salad was creamy, tart, fresh, and with the addition of fried oysters there was a perfect amount of fat to balance the acidity from the lemon vinaigrette and the pickled green beans. Overall the food was out of this world. The service was great, it feels like a team is waiting on you and everyone there is very nice. It is a market as well so while you eat you get to admire the tapestries and towels they have hanging on the wall which are all for sale. Great place to eat at with great people taking care of you.",FALSE
"Lowcountry Produce delivers in every way possible, and in no way deserves anything less than a 5 star review. This is by far both mine and my wife's favorite place to eat. The history and architecture of the building alone are worth the visit. Beautiful arches, high ceilings, and local paintings greet you upon arrival. Much of the food is locally sourced, and you can instantly tell the quality difference. The menu provides a perfect selection of true low country cuisine. The crab hushpuppies are a must try, and the oooey gooey burger is ""the best burger I've ever had"" per my wife. We have eaten here several times (would eat here more but we live in the upstate) and we have never had anything short of amazing. The service is great as well. Do not miss the opportunity to eat here when coming to Beaufort!!!",FALSE

"We are somewhat local, living about 30 minutes away.  I had heard good things and we decided to give it a try.  Lovely building, staff was busy and accommodating and we liked the vibe.  We both ordered the salmon BLT and it was phenomenal. Large piece of well seasoned fish, cooked perfectly. Bacon was crispy, tomatoes delicious and the potato roll held up well to the messy ingredients! The only reason I am not giving a 5 stars is the menu stated the sandwich was $18 and the bill reflected $22.  I know, not a ton of money but I didn't like it.  In fact, I recommended the sandwich to a gentleman who sat at the bar seating near us and I hope he felt it was worth the extra $4.  The folks working were very busy and I knew it would delay other diners so I said nothing while there. Maybe I will call this week?  Anyhow, the food was very good.",FALSE

Love this place wish I could come more from Fl,FALSE
Super cute cafe & boutique! We got a chicken salad sandwich and a pesto turkey sandwich! They were both great and unlike anything I've ever had before! Very unique blends of herbs. We also got an iced and a hot latte. Both very good! They also have smoothies and chai (I didn't see any matcha which was a bummer but I may be wrong) the shop had great stuff and great prices also. Very friendly service and nice outdoor seating as well as indoor seating.,FALSE
"Decided to try for breakfast while in beaufort  Ordered a  croissant, they were already out at 9 am on Saturday, ok ordered sticky bun then was told no icing left.  While waiting,  another customer returned something that was still frozen and the young lady offered to heat it up for her and refund. It was disheartening to go to a cafe and get something frozen. My husband had the blt and it was great.  Just let down by bakery items.  Didn't look at shop I was ready to go by that point.",FALSE

The staff were exceptionally friendly and kind, and are some of the nicest people in Beaufort. I have only heard excellent things about M&M and am so happy I made the trip!",FALSE

There is 1 waitress and the host who takes your order as well. For just being 2 in the front, they handled the packed restaurant very well.
We ordered our appetizers, entrees, bobas all at once. The kitchen was BUSY yall. We didn't wait long for all of it to start coming out.

"I regularly purchased food from the Kitchen and for the most part the food is very good.  The store is nice and always clean.

The other day I took my Mother in to get some meals for the week. We both spent over $100 on the trip.  I purchased teriyaki noodles as I have on many other occasions. When I heated them I found a small piece of wood which stuck me in the tongue as I was eating them.  I call the Kitchen on Lady's Island and told the girl who answered what had happened and she went to get someone from management.  I explained that I had found a small piece of wood in my food and I had rinsed it to make sure of what it was as I know noodles can harden on the sides.  This was not food as it splintered apart like wood.

I told them I didn't as much care about a refund as letting them know so no one else had an issue. They asked if I had a picture so I sent it. They said it was a bean sprout and that they didn't use anything made from wood so it couldn't be said Thank you and hung up.

I was truly annoyed.  I am able to tell the difference between an over cooked bean sprout and a piece of wood that stuck me in the tongue & if this was a bean sprout able to do that then it probably shouldn't be used in food.. A piece of wood may have come in anywhere from any of the vegetables.

I purchase regularly from the Kitchen and rarely post anything negative but, I was so annoyed about how this was handled. I called to help them out not for money back not that that was offered. I was truly disappointed as we eat from the Kitchen several times a month and between my mother, husband and myself spent a good bit there.  This is not customer service",FALSE
,FALSE

"I came into the store and was immediately met with an unfriendly glare from one of the girls at the counter  no greeting, no acknowledgment, just attitude. I let it go, thinking maybe she was having a rough day.

A few minutes later, I noticed two girls whispering behind the counter while looking at me. The one that gladed at me when i initially came in walked over to the area i was checking out, twice, ""browsed"" through the freezers next to me, then when I glanced over she stood there glaring at me. Then I noticed a male employee join in, also staring.

I don't know what their problem was, but the way I was treated was completely unprofessional and disrespectful. I came in to buy food, not to be watched, whispered about, or made to feel unwelcome.

We all have bad days and opinions, but there's no reason to push them on me.

For 2 tenders and a handful of fries for 12 bucks is alot. The quality didn't match the price either. The 2 (TWO) tenders I did receive were very hard and almost to the point I could have broken a tooth. Maybe I just came on a bad day or at a bad time.

I got the Beyond Meat vegan burger for myself which was reallyyy good.(The patty could've been smashed a little flatter and cooked a little longer it was thick and kind of soft inside but still good). I was happy and appreciative to know he offered vegan options considering I am a vegan. The R&B music playing out loud added a great touch definitely a vibe on a nice day like today.

I also had a free burger coupon for being a new member, but it took five people to figure out how to process it. Eventually, I left and was told to come back later to get my free burger.

"This was my first time going to hop dog. The design is cool, very unique. Everything else not so much. The customer service was average, there weren't many choices to choose from if you don't like alcohol, the popcorn was very stale and and not warm at all. That was disappointing especially since you have to pay almost $4. I could get better popcorn for free at Grayco thats warm with better customer service. The food was the most disappointing. I ordered a build your own hot dog. The bun was good, the hot dog tasted good, but lukewarm. Then all my condiments made the hot dog worse. I had cold onions, cold shredded cheese, pickled relish, ketchup, and mustard. Basically I ate a cold hot dog. What did it for me was the fact that every single table they had available for seating was disgusting. There was food on every table so I had to strategically sit where I wouldn't get ketchup or cheese on my clothes or where I wouldn't sit in a puddle of water. I really wanted to enjoy this, but to be quite honest it was the worst experience I have had at any of the establishments downtown. When I go to an establishment I appreciate good customer service, hot food, and cleanliness. Hop dog did not exhibit any of these. Maybe next time would be better.",FALSE
Great hot dogs. Great selection of beers and cocktails. A nice casual way to spend time with friends. Outside seating for those who have dogs. (No pun intended),FALSE
could not have been more pleased with how good the food was. taking a simple hot dog and completely taking it to a new level.,FALSE
,FALSE
"The hotdog wasn't very good. I got the Chicago type dog. Just was bland, and the pickle spear was cut in half and put in each side of the dog, making me think it was a whole spear. Service and atmosphere was good. It's just not very good food.",FALSE
I love the fact you can bring your dog here!! The food id great! The staff was very friendly!! Check them out!!!,FALSE
"I stopped by Hop Dog to grab lunch for myself and my hardworking boyfriend - he was busy, I was hungry, and I just needed something quick for us... or so I thought. What I found instead? A whole experience. This place is an absolute vibe. Think clean white interiors, bold red accents, fun signage - like Scandinavian design walked into an arcade and said, ""Let's make it cute.""

You don't just order a hotdog here - you step into a little world where anything feels possible. Popcorn machine? Yep. Cocktails on tap? Obviously. Arcade machine glowing in the corner? Of course. Cotton candy? I didn't see it, but I wouldn't be shocked. It's a little all over the place, but that's part of what makes it fabulous. Bring your kids and your dogs and have fun!!

And the food? Oh. My. God. I ordered the hotdog with caviar and gold flakes  because how could I not? It was dramatic, salty, shiny, and honestly kind of perfect. Was it worth $40? Debatable. Would I do it again? Absolutely. The Insta story alone was worth it.

My boyfriend had the HopDog - and he's usually a ""meh"" hotdog type of guy - but he genuinely liked it. That says a lot. They know what they're doing.

And the woman working there? An absolute angel  So friendly and upbeat - her energy totally made the place feel warm and special. You can tell she loves being there and it rubs off on everyone walking in. In the best possible way.

Hop Dog is fun, chaotic, stylish, and a little iconic. Not just a hotdog place - it's got charm, good food, and a lot of personality. It might just be my new go-to. Next time, I'm staying for a cocktail and the full sit-down fantasy. Be ready, folks, Mikkel is about to be back ",FALSE
"My wife and I moved to Beaufort recently and were pleasantly surprised to find this place on google. The hot dogs are pretty damn good. Yes it feels kinda weird to pay 20 bucks for two hot dogs when you can make 10 of them at home for that same price, but then again, that's the case with almost every restaurant you go to!! No complaints from me.",FALSE

My husband and I had the meatball appetizer which was the best meatballs we have EVER had out and plenty for both of us.  We shared a salad.  All fresh greens and yummy dressing.   We shared the sausage and pepper pizza and I will never go anywhere else in this area for pizza.  The sauce was so good.  The pizza was thin and the crust was crispy and a little burnt to bring out the flavor - just the way we like it!  The bar top is made of oyster shells and gorgeous!  Keep up the good work!  Highly recommend 1711 Tap House!

We went back and had their lemon pepper wings and they were delicious!  None I have ever had prior compare to how good these wings were!  Outstanding!  I will add a photo...",FALSE
,FALSE
"The atmosphere is unique and beautiful with a well stocked bar(the chianti pairs well with everything). Our server, Rachel, was very attentive and gave us the best suggestions!

Everything was fresh and delicious, thank y'all for an amazing experience! 10/10, I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu",FALSE

""Wings for the Buffalonians, Pizza for the Gods""

Stopped in at 1711 Tap House and let me tell you -- my taste buds are still doing a victory lap. I ordered the Hot Buffalo Wings and the Tour of Italy Pizza.

The wings? Solid. They had the kick to keep a true Buffalonian like me satisfied (which is saying something), but I'll admit, I was secretly wishing for one more turn of the spice dial -- just enough to make me break a sweat and question my life choices. Still, they got the job done, crisp and saucy without being stingy.

The Tour of Italy Pizza though... my God. Whoever dreamed that up deserves a medal, a key to the city, and maybe their own national holiday. Perfect crust, flavors that made me feel like I had been adopted by an Italian grandmother, and just the right balance of toppings. It was so good I nearly proposed to it -- and I'm not ruling out going back with a ring.

Bottom line: 1711 Tap House isn't just a place to eat, it's a place to believe in food again. If you go, don't skip the pizza. And if you're a spice junkie like me, maybe whisper to the chef to hit those wings with a little extra heat.

Highly recommend. Bring napkins, stretchy pants, and the will to be happy.",FALSE
"Nice place, but I thought this was a tap house sort of place where there would be dozens of craft beers on tap. There were a dozen or so, but the beer list included Bud, Coors, PBR, etc., so not craft oriented. Also, the beer list is severely lacking in details such as ABV's, type of hops, etc. and incorrect in a few cases. The waitress admitted her complete ignorance of beer, though she was very nice and attentive. The meatball appetizer was excellent so between that and a flight (4) of good craft beers, I was satisfied. But this is NOT a genuine tap house.",FALSE
Delicious! Fun! Great employees.,FALSE
"Our food took an hour and a half.With no appology Then shimp way over cooked even blackened fried . We came in from Summerville,S.C.",FALSE
I was a regular there. Had an issue with a female bartender when she was not working. Sitting in her car she accused me of hitting her vehicle. Tried extorting me for $700 to not call the police. I called the police and they took pictures of her vehicle and mine. Next time I went in I was told I was barred by the owner. Will never return. Not that they are concerned.,FALSE
Apparently a guy can't buy a girl a drink. Your bar tender tonight is straight trash! Not just even one star. First time there and never going back.,FALSE

"Fish sandwich was mushy, shrimp burger was maybe a three star. Staff was decent and the beer was cold.  About average for Beaufort.",FALSE
"Was here on friday july 18th getting a couple of drinks before the concert. Bartender was very rude and accused me of giving her a fake ID even though it was a valid CDL drivers license. I informed her that the ID was in fact real and she served me a drink. She ran my card and gave it back to the wrong group... luckily i noticed and got my card back. Came back for another one and she promptly turned me away saying she didn't trust me and that she can't accept my ID anymore. She waved her hand in my face and said ""BYE""... I showed her not only my CDL, but also my regular drivers license and debit card with a matching name, she still refused me service. Not sure why as I tipped on the first round regardless of quality of service and remained respectful the entire time. I didn't get her name but she was short and had brown hair. Ended up getting my ID verified my a police officer, still was denied service inside. I was then taken care of by a very nice bartender setting up outside. The second bartender turned the experience around for us, much appreciated being treated like a human being.",FALSE
"Luther's has always been a staple in our family for many years. The last few years it has gone downhill fast. There is one employee in particular that ruins it for the entire restaurant. Not sure what her name is, but she is a larger girl with a loud deeper voice with her hair in a bun on top of her head. She seems to act like she runs the place, and I do hope I am mistaken. She has always been rude, obnoxious, unpleasant, unwelcoming, and seems to hate her job. People like that is what ruins a business. You can feel the toxic environment she carries as soon as you walk in the door. Until this is changed, I do not recommend Luther's to anyone.",FALSE
"Actually, I was going to go to another restaurant next door, but it was too crowded. Oh, I didn't want to wait, so we had to sit here.
The tables outside were empty, so we sat at one. The waiter didn't pay attention to us for a long time (more than 15 minutes). I even went inside and got the menu myself.
The outside atmosphere wasn't very good. I can say that the inside is more lively and cute. But if you want to find good service and good food, this place shouldn't be your first choice. I had the chance to try hamburgers, shrimp, sandwiches... etc., but I only ate my fill. I can't say that I really enjoyed what I ate.
The only thing I liked was that they gave food to a street cat.  We can say that it's an animal-friendly restaurant. There were water bowls for dogs outside.",FALSE
"Went inside upon arrival and told hostess we wanted to sit outside. She said go ahead so we went to vacant dirty table (all tables were dirty), and started to move some of the items so we could sit. The waitress came running over nearly hysterical that we not sit down until she clears the table.

We ordered and sipped our drinks while we looked over the menu. Waitress never came back and had to ask waitress from the other section (who was very attentive to her customers and had triple the amount of tables) to send our waitress over. We put in our food order and ordered another drink. Waitress kept saying Coolers light instead of Coors Light and so we asked why she said it that way thinking maybe it was a joke. She said, ""'it's the accent"" and gave a HUGE eye roll, grabbed the menus and walked off. NOT a good vibe at this establishment. Food was not the very good and service was terrible; did I mention another couple came and sat beside us and finally got up and left because they were never approached by waitstaff. Management needs to do some serious coaching. Would NOT recommend.",FALSE

Wasn't really hungry but wanted to get a feel for their food so we ordered fries. The bartender said ""careful, they're hot"". They were not. At all. But the seasoning on them was very good.

Meat was cut up small enough that we didn't have to cut it. The vegetables were perfect. The roll was delicious. You can easily get 2 meals out of your order as the portions are plentiful.

"I had dinner last week at the Ribaut Social Club in the Anchorage 1770 in Beaufort while I was in town visiting family who live there.  We dined out on the porch where we had a perfect and gentle evening breeze and a gorgeous view of the river.  The food was delicious and fresh, and we enjoyed the special summer cocktail list.  Service was what you would expect at one of the fine dining establishments in town: attentive, friendly, and not rushed.
The food was not as creative as I'd hoped for, but it was my first time at the restaurant and I'd heard many people rave about the chef's creativity, so I may have had somewhat high expectations.  I also heard that the restaurant is in the process of hiring a new executive chef, so we may have timed our visit poorly during that transition.  Even so, the meal was delicious and served beautifully.
This is a perfect restaurant for a special occasion, as the dishes are quite pricey, but if you have the chance to splurge, this is a great option!  It ranks as one of the finest restaurants in the Beaufort area, and the location in such a historic building with the view out over the water make it worth the cost!",FALSE

We came into town to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and made reservations over a month prior and were really looking forward to celebrating it at the Ribaut since we had great experiences the last 2 times. We had heard there was a new chef, which made us a little nervous but we tried it anyway. The tag-team wait staff were not on the same page and we had to repeat our orders a few times. Service was slow. The crab cakes we had were bland and underwhelming. My husband's filet came out medium (when we had ordered it to be medium rare and even mentioned that he likes it more on the rare side) so they took it back. I ordered the octopus risotto and was sadly disappointed in how overcooked, tough and chewy the octopus came out and the rest of the dish lacking flavor.  There was about 20 minutes from the time they took his steak until we finally got someone to come to our table to ask if we needed anything, although they went to check on every other table except for ours. My husband went back to see why and they were going to offer us more complementary wine but we refused.
When they finally brought the second steak out, it was dry and over salted. We didn't even want to try desert because everything else had already been a disappointment. We ended up paying almost $200 for a less than subpar meal. I used to recommend this place to everyone but now I'm sad to say that it has changed for the worse.",FALSE

Under cooked roasted parsnips, rice or mashed potatoes alongside large slabs of meat. Where was the flair we were used to?

Our drinks were never even allowed to get half empty before we had refills, and he even got us drinks to go. Oh yeah, and my husband ordered the Monster Margarita, which was the size of 3 margaritas anywhere else, and only cost $15.99.

We arrived for late dinner about 830pm on Thursday night and just got started eating when a worker came to our table to let us know they closed at 9pm.. clearly we hadn't finished and wasn't just chatting actually eating yet he made it clear we needed to finish up. We did and decided to go outside after cleaning our mess up and was sitting on the patio talking and once again came outside to tell us they close at 9pm at this time it was already 10pm but there was new people inside eating so why the rush on us grown adults just sitting outside?!!.

Worst hibachi we have ever had. Shrimp was over cooked. They served us bad scallops. They smelled terrible and were slimy. I had to stop my family from eating them. After talking to the cook he called another employee ( possibly a manager) she offered us more shrimp to replace the bad scallops. Thise shrimp were also over cooked. I didn't get sushi but several of my family mebers did. They said the sushi was good. Never saw our waitress again after the hibachi chef showed up. The cooked squirter something in my face that he said was sake. I assumed it was water but it smelled terrible and burned. I would not suggest this place to anyone.

I said are you serious? Me the customer needs to remind you how long it takes for hibatchi to cook?
They brought out as my party was finnishing, just in time for everyone to leave.
I said im not paying for it right?
They said well then your not taking it. When aaked what they were going to do with it they said throw in trash.
So i said, instead of provide me with meal that you messed up for us, you would rather throw away.
And they sure did. The owner himself did it right in front of me.
I would never go back or recommend this place due to the lack of professionalism.",FALSE
"Was greeted by a friendly host. We asked if there was a wait. The host said about 20 mins. We thought not bad, we'll wait. Our wait was an hour and a half almost two hours. There were only two cooks for the hibachi with 4 large parties. We would have appreciated if the host was honest on the wait time. It was our daughter's birthday and the spot was where she wanted to celebrate. The waitress was by far the worst. There was definitely a language barrier which resulted in the cook, cooking the wrong food. We had to request for the order that was not being cooked on the flat top so our toddler could eat. Overall experience was horrible. The chicken was overcooked and hard, the chef interaction would have been better if we were starved out by the time he got to us. Which was not his fault. If the hostess would have made it clear that there was going to be an hour or more wait we would have decieded to come back another time. That choice was taken from us.
Please be honest with your guest about wait time that played a major part, biggest part was the waitress not understanding our order.",FALSE

My kids enjoyed their pepperoni pizza, but they also rave about Little Caesar and school pizza so I'm not sure their palates are reliable... I ordered eggplant Parmesan but sent it back bc it very cold. I just asked for it off the bill since I didn't want to upset the kitchen staff.

Let's not forget nothing had any taste, so bad we had to salt everything and question if we had Covid or it was just that unbelievably tasteless.

"As a Thai food fanatic, and former Thai restaurant owner, this place is as authentic as it gets in the US.

Service is friendly, and slow but matches the vibes.

The yellowtail appetizer was amazing, but be prepared for spice as the jalepeno is fresh.

Summer and spring rolls are very good. Spring rolls are unique as they had chicken, but the summer rolls were the hit as the vegetables were fresh, and offset the soft texture of the shrimp.

The pad khing was on point! I got it with cashews added (my own recommendation off menu) and I added the dry chili peppers on my own. Sanbol I would not recommend for this cuisine.

Our kids had the fried rice, once the vegetables were picked out they loved it. But the flavor was great.

My wife had the pad Thai, and it was reddish in color (as it is supposed to be) and had a great flavor.

90$ with tip for 4 people with 3 appetizers!

We then ordered Summer Rolls. The sauce for that is so tasty. We always ask for two dishes of sauce, one with the chopped peanuts, the other without and that threw our server off. We got the initial dish with peanuts so we reminded her of the second one without peanuts. It took a bit, but we finally got it.

One person ordered Pad Thai with beef and he requested no peanuts on the dish; another ordered Pad Thai with tofu. I had the Satay Chicken appetizer as my meal. The beef dish came with so many peanuts, there was no way to just pick them off so it was sent back to have remade without peanuts. The Satay Chicken comes with a sauce and I asked to have chopped peanuts added on top and it took quite a while to finally get that.

When we finished the server asked if it was all on one check or split. We explained how it should be split, but, unfortunately, when the bills came, after quite a delay, they were incorrect.

Typically the service is also very good, but today's service left a little to be desired. We are hoping that the server is new and service will improve next time. It will not stop us from returning, because the flavor of the food is the most important. Bad/slow service just distracts from the whole experience.

"This review is gonna be based strictly on the customer service and management / owner i ordered a pizza through DoorDash. Because when you go to their website and you hit the button that says order. It takes you to DoorDash. I paid for it through DoorDash. Sent my husband up there to get it. And the girl said that it was a DoorDash. And did not want to give him the pizza after he gave her my name and it says take out on the ticket.  So of course, my husband got upset and said just refunded. The manager said he could not refund it and would not refund it. Needless to say, I had to get dressed, go up there, pick up the pizza.
Which was an hour and 10 minutes later because I was trying to get my money back through DoorDash and I could not. They would only credit me $3. So $24.76 basically went in the trash.  When I go back up there to look at the ticket, it clearly says it's takeout through DoorDash with my name on the ticket. I don't know what the big deal was. But they did not want to accommodate me in any way shape. Or form.  At this point I just picked it up came home and threw it in the trash. Because I don't want to eat something. That was so argued over no telling what they could have done to it. I just had a very bad taste in my mouth. After this. Long ordeal about just picking up a pizza. It did not need to be so hard.

"IMPORTANT READ *not a paid review* TL;DR

Great ice cream, really expensive and always an issue with missing ingredients or charging the wrong price for the wrong size.

Myself and my Girlfriend have gone here 3 times over the past couple months and I will say this:

They have some of the best ice cream we have ever had. HOWEVER, the first time we came we were met by someone starting their first shift ever so admittedly the staff was busy training her so service took a while, can not blame them for that. I ordered a sundae and they said they can't make it because they are out of that ice cream, mind you we showed up less than an hour after opening. A few minutes after paying they began to realize they were out of the ingredients for the compromised item what we ordered, so they substituted with other ingredients without informing us and still charged full price. I know this because I could hear them whispering about 2 feet in front of me. Not a big issue, just bad service. Nice kids, obviously their first job.

Second visit, we decided to give it another chance because the ice cream is actually very good. Despite giving time for them to iron out some service kinks, the exact same issues were there the second time. Didn't have the ingredients for either item we ordered, had to settle for the incomplete item for full price. A little ridiculous but again, not a huge issue.

Third visit is what blew my mind. We have ordered the same thing every time, medium sundaes. This time there was 2 new employees I have never seen. Both young kids. After ordering our items (2 medium 3 scoop sundaes for $18. Ridiculous btw). It took about 3 minutes for them to even start looking for our ingredients. A few minutes pass and they whisper to eachother right in front of us:

""do you know how to make either of these things""

""No""

""Ok."" *both look at the menu with ingredients clearly listed*

""We are out of that""

They proceed to make the ice cream for us but this time not only did it have missing ingredients, it was also two sizes smaller than what a medium was the last two visits, yet still $18 for two single scoops of ice cream.

After the kid handed my girlfriend hers, she asked him if that was the right size because it was significantly smaller than the same order we always get. He said it was the right size. Obviously he was wrong so I picked up the medium sized cup they have labeled and on display that says on it ""medium, 3 scoops.""
He said ""oh. Well I was told this is our medium."" That's interesting because the display has the size I always get, the menu even said medium is 3 scoops because it costs $9.

So in conclusion: They refused to remake the proper size, STILL was missing the ingredients required to make the sundae, and charged full price. We got 1/3 of the ice cream we usually get which totaled one scoop for each of us for $18.

The place is obviously a bunch of high school kids working their first job which I have no issue with. As somebody with a background and food service, I will tell you, you should never have an inexperienced employee on shift without a shift manager or an experienced employee to sort out issues like this. You have multiple employees admitting to not knowing what it takes to make the items, on top of not knowing they are completely out of the items before charging you full price for them and then refusing refunds or compensation. Getting sizes wrong, getting ingredients wrong, and not compensating is pretty unprofessional and inconvenient, especially when I'm paying $18 for a third of the normal amount.

Good ice cream though.",FALSE

Were vacationing in Beaufort and were craving something sweet and settled on ice cream.  After a Google search we picked Southern Sweets at random and we will be forever grateful we did! This little gem is tucked away inside an old building that is full of adorable little shops.  Walking up to it you feel like you're traveling back in time to easier days.  Walking inside and seeing the counter with the high stools completes your travel back in time.  Our party had 4 different sundaes and a cone and we were all very pleased.  Add to that the exceptional customer service and this is a place that is now definitely on our visit often list.,FALSE

Southern Sweets is a gem! Family-owned and full of charm, this old-fashioned sandwich and ice cream shop nails it with every bite. The sandwiches are loaded with premium meats (try the Southern Flair or Great Santini!) and the hot dogs are next-level--especially the Marine Dog and Southern Nights.

And the ice cream? Incredible. Tons of custom flavors, sundaes, shakes, and cones--perfect for cooling off after exploring Beaufort. Friendly service, nostalgic vibe, and seriously delicious food. A perfect taste of the Lowcountry!",FALSE

What a great experience! The smallest sundaes were not what I would call small by any means. I can only imagine what the large ones must be like if the small ones are this generous.

"Nutty-less buddy
I wanted to like this little ice cream parlor so bad. I love finding quant little local spots when i travel. I've been here a few times over the course of the last few days. For the latest visit, when i walked in there were dirty food baskets on the bar top. But there were no customers sitting at the bar. They clearly had bad sitting there for a while. The food prep area was in disarray. There were open containers scattered about and food still on the cutting boards. There were 2 young ladies working. One of the employees must have been new and didn't know what she was doing. The other was doing everything else while directing the other on how to make the different ice cream orders as they came in. A few families came in and clearly overwhelmed the 2 staff members.
It appears as though the layout of the prep area is not conducive or efficient. The members were walking back and forth finding ingredients for the Sundays.
I feel they were understaffed and the one lacked knowledge and/or proper training.
The ladies were polite and apologized for the long waits. So there's a positive.",FALSE

We finally gave up and left (which it felt like the server wanted us to leave - same lady who sat us - the only person I saw on the floor working).

This wasn't the first time either--my daughter had a similar experience here just a few weeks ago. Please, IHOP, make sure there are at least a few staff working the floor at all times.

Absolutely ridiculous how crappy the service was. Stood at the front waiting to be seated for 10 minutes before we were acknowledged. There were about 7 employees just sitting around and maybe two tables so they weren't busy. Got seated and waited another 10-15 minutes before our service came to the table. Very rude and just had no desire to be here. Food came and was burnt and just no flavor at all. Restaurant needs to be closed for a few days and a deep cleaning done. Air vents caked in dust and god only knows what else. The building has the worst musty smell. IHope was a childhood favorite and this was absolute crap.,FALSE

"We are vacationing in Beaufort and placed an online order for 6 people in my family. We drove 15 minutes to pick up our order and the lady said she did not see our order. This was around 11 pm. We took screenshots of our order that successfully was placed on our end and showed her our bank statement where we were charged for the food. She said she didn't have it and advised to go cancel the order in the app and try again. Well obviously I'm not going to do that and be double charged (that would have been $65). She said the same exact thing to the customer behind us. I have ordered Taco Bell online too many times to count  and this has never happened! I could be wrong, but I wonder if the employees just didn't want to make our food at 11pm (they are supposed to stay open until 1am). Now I have a charge on my bank statement that hopefully will be credited back toy account and no food! It was too late to order pizza by that point so we went home and made sandwiches. The girl should have made our food when we showed her our proof of purchase. You don't send customers away like that! I DO NOT recommend this Taco Bell!!! Terrible service!!",FALSE

The drive-through employees are extremely pleasant, do their part to ""sell the app"" without being pushy, smile at the windows, quickly process orders, and get it right.

They argued that I ordered the wrong thing, yet I ordered exactly what was listed on the sign. I asked for a refund when the staff got argumentative.

"Saddened by the lack of management at this location. In the attempt to be as impartial as possible, it may not completely be managements fault.

Hostess was cold and not welcoming. Not even a hello or look to us. She merely said "" you're over at this table over there."" We didn't even know if she was speaking to us.

Server seemed over worked, but I didn't see her have that many tables. She did not have a customer service attitude. She looked annoyed when we asked for the things that we had asked for several times as politely as humanly possible. Bad days simply cannot exist in the service industry. I feel bad for her as I am sure she is going through something rough. But no excuse.

Food came out at different times, to different tables on the same expeditor. Weird and unprofessional.

My beer took 20 min to arrive at the table. My salad with ranch came with blue cheese. The bbq sauce we asked for came after we asked 3 different employees.

Kids meals came without ketchup, and after we had asked for it, it never came.

Recommend district management come to fix the management in this store as it does not seem localized to one person. as a person who started in service.

Much more, but basically the food was the same quality as always as we are not frequent customers of chain restaurants and the service was abominably bad.

Sad to say we most likely will not be returning anytime soon.",FALSE

We haven't been to outback in YEARS because of customer service and food quality and it seems like things haven't changed. Sidnie was our server. We were the first ones in at opening and the last ones served. We was there to chat of course but absolutely no way was our food supposed to come as late as it did and when it did it was below food temp. Drinks wasn't refilled in a timely manner & whoever brought out the food had to help us clear the clutter on the table from the bread plate. One of my sisters didn't enjoy her food because she ordered medium and it definitely came out rare. The sweet potatoes felt like it was just quickly thrown together. I felt as if we wasn't taken as a priority. Me working food and beverage before it gave the impression of us being treated as the table that ""wasn't going to tip"" (which of course I did). Towards the end when it was time to pay I brought it to Sidnie's attention who didn't seem so pleased about helping making things right. She went to get her manager who did the right thing & as I was walking out I told Sidnie to have a great day & I got side eyed. We're totally not coming back!

I had to repeat myself many times, she blamed the slow tablet. Probably took over 30 minutes to get our drinks and food. We were there for atleast two hours. Never got our alcoholic drink till we asked for the check. The bartender magically just made it..either the bartender was slow or she just didn't remember we ordered it and never went by to check if it was ready. She said the bartender was not great today and she was sorry. That was weird.  Like who wants their drink after appetizers and meals were eaten and we were ready to go. We felt forgotten, took forever to get anything. No one walked by us to check on if we needed anything. The waitresses were not attentive at all, to all the tables around us too. Nothing off the check for the long wait and inconvenience of the bartender. Food was good though. Hopefully the manager can fix this issue because we love outback but we will think twice before going again due to the long wait & bad service even when they weren't busy.",FALSE

Paid over 50 dollars for 2 family meals and drinks. I drove all the way home to find out all they gave me was the chicken. I called and said they forgot the fries and toast and the guy was very confused sounding.

"The saying of ""getting screwed in the drive-through"" applies to this Zaxby's. I ordered two meals for my wife and myself, both specifically with Coleslaw. I read it right off of the menu board. Neither meal came with slaw. Both came with a gross amount of fries. Way too many fries for anyone to eat. All of the food in our containers was cold. Cold fries, cold chicken, and cold bread. Unpleasant. When we were paying, I noticed a dozen young people ""working"" (which is a good thing!) at something, all behind the counter and in the food service area. They were laughing and enjoying themselves (again, good!) as they were about climbing over and around each other. Perhaps they were just having ""too much fun"" to ensure the food was warm and orders were correct. Also, my wife and I ordered two different meals; we both received the exact same foods in our boxes. I received more chicken stripes and more French fries, but otherwise, identical. My meal was about $15 and her meal was $9.60. Confusing. We've like Zaxby's. Everything considered from today, I believe we'll go to KFC across the street.

Then, unbelievably, she told us we couldn't eat it there, even though we had already purchased coffee. That's ridiculous. If they're going to force customers to order online for certain items, then refuse to let them eat it in the restaurant after serving it to their table, what exactly are we paying for?

I mention to her she should bring it to the cook's attention and her reply was that was his business. It has a sign on the door that extra eggs would be a 1.00. The charge was on our bill and no one ever ask for an extra egg.  IHOP and Waffle House will get ALL of our business from now on. And NO more sweet potato fries!,FALSE

"Huddle House in Beaufort Sc. The day of my visit. Michael was the cook and went above and beyond his job.  He overheard me asking about french toast several times. A few years ago it was on the menu. This Time  it was not, so I asked about it. I was told french toast was no-longer served for breakfast. That's when michael the cook came over and asked if that's what I would like to have for breakfast. I said yes and he went and made a special order of french toast, which was absolutely delicious. Even decorated the plate, so if you're in the area stop at the huddle house Beaufort SC.  Michael is one of a kind!!. Most people would have continued on with what they were responsible for. If you ask me he's management material. So corporate, you need to pay close attention. To Michael the cook our waitress was also wonderful. I just did not get her name.

I ordered the Pollo Espinaca, which is chicken breast covered with mushrooms, spinach, and a cheese sauce.  It came with rice & beans.  The flavor was really good, and seasoned well.  The only negative was that the chicken breast was unevenly cook.  It's butterflied and grilled and parts were very tender and other parts were a bit chewy.  Otherwise, the dish was fabulous.

Enough for two to split or get one each it so good you might not want to share, it's served with cucumber slices, radish slices and a  pickled spicy food item that we were unfamiliar with.

Our lunch, I had the Pollo Vallarta and my husband had the Seafood chimichanga.
My dish was nice and hot. The plated food was very pleasing to the eye. The taste was excellent! Everything about the chicken, shrimp and pineapple was beautifully blended. The salad mix and rice were also very tasty. The portion was a good amount.

"I will start by saying I submitted my concern via the Waffle House website while we were there on 7/2.  I also gave the exact time so they could watch on the CT recording - since there are signs saying they record. Once submitted the site said it would notify the owner. I left my contact info but have not been contacted (as of 7/15) so I can only assume my concerns have not been resolved.
We were the only family in WH and sat at the counter because my kids like to watch them cook. There were two workers that we saw - the waitress and cook. Eventually a man came in and also ordered. Our food was almost ready when the waitress asked the cook to ""pull bacon"". The cook, with gloves on his hands, grabbed raw bacon from the fridge and started cooking it then WITH THE SAME GLOVES that touched RAW PORK finished putting our plates of finished food together.

They were pleasant, but I didn't notice that they needed to clean up the area where they're making the food and as I got my food and was leaving the restaurant, there were obvious things on the floor, broken tortilla chips and paper from straws, and couple of spills. I don't know if they were short staffed today and it was just really busy. It is a Sunday and I know a lot of people after Church stop in to these locations but they should have someone cleaning up busing tables on a regular basis other than that I will go again because their food is good and I had a very pleasant experience.

Arrived at drive through shortly after posted opening time. Waited several minutes but was never greeted. Drove around went in store. Nothing was cooked or ready.

It was a stormy, gross, rain soaked Saturday. These two (whose names escape me at the moment) churned out orders and good service. The gentleman even handled a particularly difficult customer (who returned TWICE for pedantic reasons AFTER receiving her order...anyway...) with a courteous and respectful attitude. I would probably not have been quite as professional in that situation.

The one thing that this restaurant needs is a roof and ceiling upgrade. When I came in on 8/16, several ceiling tiles had fallen and smooshed on the ground in a soggy pile of drop ceiling, dust, and despair. Evidence of other leaky spots was there, too.

I stopped,opened my container and lo and behold, there were bo bites that have been waiting there for about 12 hours.... They were dark crumbly cold and dry....

I have no idea how this store is still open or the personnel is still getting paid but this isn't the only time this has happened and I hope no one else has to deal with the annoyance and aggravation this has caused just for some as simple of telling the customer they are busy or backed up instead of ignoring calls and being content with customers waiting hours,FALSE

I just wanna know why are they always saying you can't order carbonated drinks? Whoever orders what they need to make things needs to do better. Always being out of all carbonated beverages is crazy for a fast food place. I was surprised the tea tasted like it had mildewed since they were out of all carbonated beverages. Food was bad too.

Average. Overpriced. They used to grill the Rueben. Now just toasted. Not enough sauce or sour kraut. The slider was 1.99 and made a Krystal burger look huge.

Very nicely cooked medium with fries.
We both had the clam chowder it was hot and full of clam meat. The burger was a 1/2 pound plenty to share.
The entertainment was the sweet grass angles. They did great. It was a good night out for us.
Thanks guys for a great night.

Someone was ordering food and another person (who def knew the employee) was snickering in the dining room. The employee was rude too. I saw at least 5 customers turned away. Whoever owns this subway should be ashamed of themselves for allowing their store to be run in this manner. Do better. Way better. Besides that one lady, everyone has been rude to me.

So incredibly disrespectful! Then he told me he would make the food and I could pick it up. Uh not now because what makes me think you aren't going to mess with my food? I said I wanted a refund. He said he could only give me a store credit. Why would I go back when the food we did get, was not even edible? Absolutely not. He refused to give me a refund and said I would have to talk to his General Manager tomorrow. No. Absolutely unacceptable. I reached out to chat support and they are going to call me back for a refund. I am appalled at the lack of respect or even basic common courtesy the ""manager"" Alex displayed. Then he had the nerve to tell me ""calm down sweetheart."" So disgusting. He should 100% be fired.

We waited for the tracker to indicate the order was ready and then pulled up to the curb and followed the cues in the app to indicate we had arrived. We waited for 18 minutes while employees walked around aimlessly in the lobby and behind the counter.

Nothing good to say about this parkers besides the convenience.,FALSE
How do you move the most foul employee to Asst. Mgr.? A very bad look for the store. As a cashier she never had a hello or a smile. Ask her a question the attitude is nasty!! Hopefully enough ppl report her to get her moved on! You don't belong in that position if you can't or don't want to deal with the public.,FALSE
Found a large chunk of silicone-like plastic in a pepperoni roll as I was eating it.,FALSE

Great service.",FALSE
"5/12/21 during a shortage they were limiting the fuel people could buy. Unfortunately it seemed to be random as to whom they would limit. The U-Haul next to me ran his card and filled up multiple times. But my pump got shut off and I was told I couldn't get more. I have a large truck and haul feed for the local livestock owners. I couldn't even get enough fuel to make it home after work. The manager was no help. I fill up a 48 gallon diesel tank multiple times a week but I won't ever be doing that at Parker's again.
Note, I had made this review already but it has somehow disappeared so this is a repost.",FALSE
Dom the cashier is rude stands back there on her phone in front of customers very rude and not professional at all. She acts like us as customers are a burden to wait on. This is Parker on lady's Island,FALSE

Our favorite place in Beaufort. Moved from Napa and difficult to find great farm to table dining experiences joined with genuine hospitality and service. Excellent from the moment we walk in and Melanie and Matt greet us!,FALSE
The wife and I stumbled across this place for lunch. We sat outside which was extremely comfortable. The waitress was so friendly. She was extremely kind to us and was very helpful with explaining the menu. The wife chose the Szechwan Noodle Salad. She loved it!! I had a bite and was very fresh and tasted amazing. I had the soup of the day and a BLT. Both the soup and the BLT were delicious. I would highly recommend going to this restaurant.,FALSE
"Excellent locally owned and operated bistro. Melanie and the staff are great, and the food is amazing.",FALSE
One of the best restaurants in Beaufort SC!,FALSE

"Could not eat chips because they were cooked in rancid oil. Asked for some that were edible and waiter said they all tasted that way because they were all from the same batch. Not a good answer.

Went by again last week and the grease and chips were still rancid. I guess it saves them money to cook in rancid grease",FALSE
"Nice location, fantastic wait staff. Food came.out very fast for a busy Friday night. I will say the portions were huge. Chips were fresh, guacamole and salsa were fresh and delicious. The main entrees left us a little disappointed, as the flavor wasnt really there in the burritos (3 different kinds) or the nachos we ordered. Unsure if this is the norm, or just a fluke for this place, but we've been wanting to visit due to the local rave reviews. Maybe we will give it another try on a slow night...",FALSE
First time eating at this Agave location.  Such a great atmosphere. We had a very large gathering and the staff were very accommodating. Service was pretty awesome given the amount of people we had. Drinks and food were coming out pretty quick as well and that's because we were upstairs. I really enjoyed it and would recommend.,FALSE
Great food and great customer service!,FALSE
"The service cannot be beat, this staff is constantly running to make sure you get your food hot and fast. Great margs also!",FALSE

"After looking over the menu online (which had so many ridiculous typos that I lost count), I was presented with a very limited lunch menu when I arrived, with a reasonably-priced but very confusing combo section. Also definitely a language barrier with the waitress, which is frustrating and tiring. Got yes or no answers that didn't make any sense to questions about what my options were.

Ordered chile relleno with pastor and got chicken. Ordered a Baja fish taco and got a shrimp taco. Had to ask for a drink menu. Couldn't find the bartender to order a drink. Had to ask for the check multiple times.

Waitress took my credit card before even giving me the check! Never had that happen before, and of course the check was incorrect. They charged me extra for the items I didn't order but didn't add my drink to the check. (I understood that some of the options I actually did order were extra, but they charged me more than what those would have been since they gave me the wrong options - shrimp vs. fish, etc.)

When I pointed out the issue to the waitress I was met with a blank look, then asked if I was trying to order more food! When I asked to speak to a manager, she finally just comped the drink instead of correcting anything or adding it, but I didn't even get a copy of my receipt to sign.

Food was okay, but definitely not worth the absolutely dismal service.",FALSE

The Whoppers and chicken fries are good from Burger King  ,FALSE
"I waited for 35 minutes in front of the drive through ordering screen. This place is severely understaffed, as I watched over a dozen cars pull off from behind me to leave from the wait. You don't pay them enough for them to work that hard - hire more staff.

I have never really cared if someone was a softer spoken person but these girls have absolutely no customer service anything in their body. Super disrespectful and need a reality check.",FALSE
"Usually the food is very good.  On my last three visits, the restaurant was closed due to lack of employees once, on the following visit the service was excellent and so was the food, on my last visit the burger was hard and seemed old or over done.

Our pizza was delivered without notice and left on the floor in front of our door for who knows how long.  Gross.  I was told that the owner refuses to hire drivers to save money and unfortunately there is no way to hold DoorDash drivers accountable for the condition of your order when it arrives.

Excellent banana leaf rice. The vegetable sides were fresh and they were generous with refills. The fried bittergourd is a must-try. Can be very crowded.,TRUE

Best restaurant in town. The food is wonderful and the service is excellent. Highly recommended for any occasion.,TRUE

Terrible food. Just awful. I would not recommend this place to anyone. A complete waste of time and money.,TRUE

Authentic and delicious South Indian vegetarian food. The thosai and poori were fantastic. The chutneys were fresh and flavourful. Very clean place.,TRUE
"Consistently good xiao long bao. The skin is delicate and the soup is flavourful. Can be a long queue during peak hours, so plan ahead.",TRUE

The pork ribs are simply divine. They fall right off the bone and the BBQ sauce is addictive. Great atmosphere for a group of friends.,TRUE
Another great option for vegetarian Indian food. The menu is extensive. The mini tiffin set is great for trying a little bit of everything. Consistently good.,TRUE

"You pay for the view, not the food. The pasta I had was bland and extremely overpriced. Cocktails were good, but I would not come back for dinner.",TRUE
The lobster biryani was a unique and delicious experience. It's a bit of a splurge but worth trying at least once. The other dishes were solid too.,TRUE

"As a coffee lover, this is one of my top spots in KL. The baristas are knowledgeable and the single origin brews are always excellent. Great industrial decor.",TRUE
A legendary beef noodle spot. The dry version with the minced meat sauce is the one to get. The beef balls were bouncy and flavourful. Simple and satisfying.,TRUE

Food was cold. Curry was watery. The price was ridiculous. This place is a ripoff.,TRUE

"Standard Thai food. The tom yum was okay, a bit too sweet for my liking. It satisfies a craving but is not particularly authentic.",TRUE
"A great concept with lots of food trucks to choose from. Fun atmosphere in the evenings. The quality varies between trucks, but there's something for everyone.",TRUE

"Excellent food, excellent view, excellent service. A truly five-star experience from start to finish. Perfect for a special celebration.",TRUE
"As the name suggests, they specialize in idli. And they are very good at it. Soft, fluffy idlis with a variety of interesting chutneys. A hidden gem.",TRUE
This is the real deal. The soup is so comforting and the beef is incredibly tender. A must-try for any noodle lover in KL.,TRUE
A decent place for Spanish tapas and drinks. It has been around for ages. The food is reliable but not outstanding. Good for happy hour.,TRUE

This is my go-to for cakes. Every slice is a delight. The victoria sponge and salted caramel chocolate cake are my favourites. Consistently excellent.,TRUE

"This curry mee is rich, creamy, and packed with ingredients. A very satisfying meal, but be warned it can be quite heavy.",TRUE

"The coffee and toast are good, but the queue is insane. I waited for over an hour. It's not worth waiting that long for a simple breakfast.",TRUE
A unique 'pay as you wish' concept for a vegetarian buffet. The food is wholesome and delicious. A great social enterprise to support.,TRUE
The best ice cream! I always bring visiting friends here to try the local flavours. The salted gula melaka is a must-try.,TRUE
Famous for their 'sung yu' (big head carp) steamed with fermented black beans. The fish is always fresh and cooked perfectly. A great place for a family dinner.,TRUE

Good burger. I like this burger. The taste is good. Service is good. Yes.,TRUE

The roti canai here is unique - it's called 'roti special' and comes with two half-boiled eggs on top. It's delicious and very cheap.,TRUE
"The roast duck is excellent. Crispy skin, tender meat, and the sauce is perfect. It rivals some of the more famous, expensive places.",TRUE
You can smell the butter from down the street. A tiny shop that bakes with a lot of heart. Everything I've tried from here has been exceptional.,TRUE
A humble stall that serves amazing chapati. The chapati is always soft and fresh. The accompanying dhal and chicken curry are also very good.,TRUE
